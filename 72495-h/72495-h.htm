<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>


<p>This book is the direct outcome of experience in trying
to help teachers grow in skill in the art of teaching and in
power to appreciate the work in which they are engaged. In
the following pages have been treated as concretely as possible
the problems which the teacher faces day after day in the classroom.
Theories of education have not been discussed at any
great length, but rather those processes through which these
fundamental principles find their expression in actual teaching.</p>

<p>Terminology which it is difficult for teachers to understand
has been avoided. Although the results of studies in educational
psychology and in experimental pedagogy have been
included in the interpretation of the problems discussed, it
has not been thought advantageous to discuss at any length
any one of these investigations.</p>

<p>Many of the books which have been written for teachers
have discussed theories of teaching method without indicating
clearly the application of these principles in typical classroom
exercises. In other volumes a single type of teaching has been
emphasized to the exclusion of other equally valid methods
of instruction. In this book each of the several typical methods
of instruction has been treated, and the validity of the
particular practice indicated in terms of the end to be accomplished,
as well as the technique to be used. Since the technique
of teaching method is not the only element in determining the
efficiency of the teacher, there is included in this book a
discussion of those other aspects of the teacher’s work which
determine the contribution which she makes to the education
of the children with whom she works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span></p>

<p>In the chapter on lesson plans are given a number of illustrations
which conform to the types of exercises discussed
earlier in the book. One of the greatest needs in working
with teachers is met by this very definite provision for demonstrating
the validity of the types of teaching discussed. The
exercises given at the end of each chapter are intended to
supplement the discussions of the book by calling for an interpretation
of the thought there presented in terms of situations
with which teachers are commonly familiar.</p>

<p>To Professors F. M. McMurry, Naomi Norsworthy, and
L. D. Coffman, each of whom has read the manuscript, I am
indebted for many valuable suggestions. To Miss Kirchwey of
the Horace Mann School, Miss Steele and Miss Wright of the
Speyer School, to Miss Tall, Supervisor of Grammar Grades
in Baltimore County, Maryland, and to Dr. Lida B. Earhart
of the New York City Schools, I am indebted for lesson plans.
The outlines for the study of English, arithmetic, geography,
and history which are given in the appendix are published
with the permission of the authors and of the Teachers College
Bureau of Publications.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE AIM OF EDUCATION</span></h2>


<p>Education is worth just the difference it makes in the
activities of the individual who has been educated. The question
is not how many books did we compel the child to read;
how much does he know of arithmetic, geography, history,
music, art, and the like: but rather what use does he make of
this knowledge; how is he different from the person who does
not possess this information; and, still more important, are these
differences in his activity desirable from the point of view of
the group in which he lives. It is important, then, that we
should consider, before we discuss the function of teacher in
bringing about changes in children, the ends which it is desirable
to attain.</p>

<p>The aim of education has been variously stated. In the
popular mind the aim of education is usually interpreted in
terms of knowledge, or the ability to make a living. The
theorists have been more apt to define the purpose of education
in terms of the development of the abilities of the individual,
of growth, of culture, or of morality. It might be interesting
to examine each of the aims which has been advanced
in some detail. It may be as significant to note the element
common to all.</p>

<p>It is safe to assume that the advocates of each statement of
aim believed that their conception was broad enough to insure
success for the individual educated in accordance with the
particular ideal embodied in their statement of purpose. No
aim would be at all acceptable which did not take account of
the society in which the individual must work. The education<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
in a tribal society, which consisted in learning how to
protect one’s self and to provide for one’s physical needs,
the acquaintance with tribal ceremonies and tribal lore, quite
as truly as our modern education, fitted the individual to get
on in life. The individualistic point of view has been constantly
emphasized. It has been a case of earning a living for
one’s self, of getting culture for the satisfaction that it might
bring, of acquiring knowledge for the sake of the advancement
which was thus made possible, of moral growth for the sake of
individual salvation. More recently it has been common to
state the aim of education in terms of social efficiency. It is
the purpose of this discussion of aim to examine this concept
in order to make clear its significance.</p>

<p>When society reaches that stage of development in which
progress is definitely sought and planned for, the stage of
conscious evolution, it is not enough that the individual be
educated simply so that he may attain his own selfish ends.
Each individual is a part of the organic whole, and in his functioning
it is the good of the whole which is of paramount
importance. The aim of education must, then, be broad
enough to include both the welfare of the individual and the
good of society. Is there any real opposition between these
ends? If we think most of all of the welfare of the whole organism,
must we sacrifice the interests of the constituent parts?</p>

<p>No one can do the most for the group of which he is a member
who has not realized in his education the development of
those abilities with which he is peculiarly endowed. The
nurture of those abilities upon which society places a premium,
and the inhibition of non-social tendencies, means greater
opportunity for the exercise of whatever strength the individual
possesses, greater individual growth and development,
than would otherwise be possible. It is only through participation
in social life that the highest individual development
is possible, and it is true that “he who loseth his life” for the
good of the group “shall find it.” There is, then, no opposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
between that view of education which declares that the welfare
of society is of paramount importance, and that which
demands individual well-being. If we are successful in obtaining
the former, we must have secured the latter.</p>

<p>If the analysis of the relation of the individual to society
is correct, we are justified in claiming that any adequate statement
of the aim of education must point unmistakably to the
idea of the common good. Education aims so to adjust the
individual to the group that the welfare of society as a whole
may be advanced. This adjustment can be brought about
only through participation in social activities, and thus the aim
is constantly realized in the process.</p>

<p>In our democratic society, which makes possible free education
for all of its members, there can be no question of the
right of society to demand that education aim to develop men
and women who work for the common good. It is necessary,
then, to analyze this aim of social efficiency in terms of our
society. The equality of opportunity which we profess to
offer is to be thought of in terms of possible service which may
be rendered.</p>

<p>In any community the contribution to the general welfare
which may be made by any one of its members is conditioned
by the interests which the individual has in the general good.
The unsocial individual, the one who seldom responds to the
needs of the group, is out of sympathy with social problems,
and contributes little to social welfare.</p>

<p>But it is not enough that the individual be interested in the
common welfare. Interest may lead him to do that which is
harmful rather than helpful, or it may be that his interest may
have no result except to give him certain pleasurable emotions.
There must be added to sympathy, knowledge. Interest or
sympathy in the welfare of society may furnish the propelling
force, but knowledge is necessary for effective action. The
world is full of men and women with the best intentions who
hinder rather than advance the common good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>Since each is responsible not only for his own conduct, but
also for the welfare of the whole group, it is necessary that our
education provide opportunity for growth in intelligence.
Our schools have always emphasized this element in education.
We have often defined the aim of education in terms
of the development of citizenship. Usually the chief qualification
of the citizen has been interpreted to be that knowledge
which would enable him to exercise the right of suffrage
with intelligence. We do well, however, to remember that
intelligence must be exercised in all of the activities of life. Our
education must strive constantly to develop men and women
who will be <em>rational</em> at all times. But we may not forget that
our schools have been so much concerned with the intellectual
side of education that they have tended to neglect other elements
which are equally significant from the standpoint of
social welfare.</p>

<p>There is still another element which must be added, the habit
of acting on behalf of the group. We all know people who
know just what is demanded in a given social situation; they
profess to be interested in the welfare of the group; but they
never act. When their own private interests are involved
they are quick to seize the opportunity for improving their
condition; but in social matters they are inactive. It is in this
particular, rather than in any other, that our schools fall short.
We do much to arouse the sympathy of children in the general
welfare; we give them the knowledge by which their action may
be guided; but we give them little opportunity to form the
habit of social service. This is due to the fact that we so often
think of adult social activities as the only ones that are worth
while, forgetting that for the child the important thing is
social activity now and in his society, that the only way to
prepare for adult social effectiveness is to secure social efficiency
on the part of the child.</p>

<p>These questions still remain: how can we, through education,
produce the individual who, because of social sympathy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
knowledge, and activity, will tend to advance the welfare of all;
and what kinds of education meet the demands of the aim
which we have set up.</p>

<p>First of all, we must endeavor to produce the individual who
is sound physically. Modern education recognizes the fact
that a man’s usefulness is conditioned by his bodily condition,
and is also coming to find that physical activity is not without
its effect on the mental development and life of the individual.
There is, therefore, one large division of our work which we
may call <em>physical education</em>.</p>

<p>On the side of mental development, education consists in
preserving and stimulating the child’s interest in the materials
and processes with which he may come in contact. Intellectual
training aims to develop the man or woman who is mentally
alert, active in investigation, and controlled by reason. It is
to this <em>intellectual education</em> that our schools have devoted the
larger part of their time. The school is the agency set aside
by society for transmitting culture, and the teacher must
always concern herself largely with the intellectual life of
children.</p>

<p>Our modern view of education is leading us to stress, along
with physical and intellectual education, a kind of training
which aims to develop the individual whose moral standards
are positive rather than negative. <em>Moral-social education</em>
should establish ideals of social service as well as standards of
individual righteousness.</p>

<p>Along with physical, moral-social, and intellectual-cultural
education, there is need for that type of training which will
enable each individual to do some particular work with a high
degree of efficiency. This type of education we commonly
call vocational. It is only recently that we have come to
realize that it is not enough to train an individual with respect
to general intelligence and morality, but that it is also just as
fundamental that our education provide the training necessary
for success in the particular calling which each individual is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
to enter. For the preparation of clergymen, doctors, lawyers,
teachers, and engineers, whose vocations require a maximum
of intellectual achievement, it is true that we have long had our
vocational schools. We are coming now to appreciate the
fact that equality of opportunity demands that special training
be given to those who are to enter the industries. Indeed,
our vocational schools must multiply until there is training
offered for each and every calling before we can claim to provide
that training which is essential for social efficiency.</p>

<p>Another problem is that of the training for leisure. In
society as at present constituted, it is possible for many individuals,
and it should ultimately be possible for all, to have
a considerable amount of leisure time. The contribution of
each individual in his special line of work, and his general
interest in the whole community, will depend in a considerable
degree upon the proper use of leisure time. Our education
must, therefore, attempt to equip men with interests and ideals
which make for the nobler enjoyments.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind the sympathetic, wise, active social individual,
made so by the process of acquiring experience or
making of adjustments, both physical and mental, we have yet
to reduce our aim to the terms of schoolroom practice. What
can a teacher hope to do in this hour, with this group of children
to work with?</p>

<p>First of all the teacher can work for the formation of
habits which are socially desirable and for the inhibition of
those which are undesirable. “Education is for behavior,
and habits are the stuff of which behavior consists.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
school may be a very important factor in the formation of
habits in each of the fields of education mentioned above.
If the school is organized on a rational social basis, it must
continually present opportunities for actions which should
become habitual, and the future efficiency of the learner
depends upon gaining such control of much of the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
which we teach that the response desired becomes habitual.
The social virtues of promptness, regularity, helpfulness,
industry, fidelity, honesty, truthfulness, cleanliness, both
physical and mental, patriotism, and the like, should be made
habitual in connection with the situations which demand their
exercise. The physical habits acquired in childhood are of
the utmost significance throughout life. Much of arithmetic,
spelling, writing, geography, history, and even of literature and
art, will be significant in proportion as we have reduced our
knowledge to the automatic basis of habit. One cannot stop
to reason everything out; life is too short. We gain time and
energy for the higher activities of life in proportion as we
reduce the responses which occur frequently to the basis of
habits. In vocational schools one of the chief aims is the formation
of habits of skill. Later we shall want to discuss in
detail the methodology of habit formation.</p>

<p>Every teacher recognizes that one of the ends which must
be achieved by the school is knowledge. We shall not here
enter into the discussion of the problem of what knowledge is
of most worth, since for the teacher this choice is usually
made and prescribed in the course of study. One cannot,
however, refrain from suggesting that much that is taught
would be eliminated, if we kept constantly in mind the end
for which we strive. The following criteria, proposed by Professor
Frank M. McMurry, will be suggestive from the standpoint
of teaching, whether the teacher determines the curriculum
or not.</p>

<p>“We hold to the following propositions in the rejection of
subject matter.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>“1. Whatever cannot be shown to have a plain relation to
some real need of life, whether æsthetic, ethical, or utilitarian
in the narrower sense, must be dropped.</p>

<p>“2. Whatever is not reasonably within the child’s comprehension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>“3. Whatever is unlikely to appeal to his interest; unless it
is positively demanded for the first very weighty reason.</p>

<p>“4. Whatever topics and details are so isolated or irrelevant
that they fail to be a part of any series or chain of ideas, and
therefore fail to be necessary for the appreciation of any large
point. This standard, however, not to apply to the three R’s
and spelling.”</p>

<p>These criteria indicate clearly that knowledge can never be
in itself an end of teaching. It is not that the child may have
knowledge merely, but that he shall have knowledge which
will function. This knowledge which we seek to have the
child master will concern his physical life, his social relationships,
his vocation; and in each field the knowledge he possesses
will limit his intellectual activity.</p>

<p>The school must keep alive, or, in some cases, awaken those
interests which are socially desirable. It is not enough that
habits have been formed and knowledge acquired. Much of
the usefulness of the individual after he leaves school will depend
on his interests which lead him to acquire new knowledge,
or to attempt some new activity. It has sometimes been
asserted that the school, as at present organized, tends to kill
rather than to preserve those interests which are common to
little children. It is probable that the passing interests in
things due to curiosity must disappear, regardless of the education
which we give; but it is a poor sort of education which
leaves the child without abiding interests which will help him
not only in making a living, but also in enjoying his life.
Here, as elsewhere in education, we may be satisfied with the
result only when we get the corresponding action. That child
has an interest in good literature who reads good literature.
We can be sure that the boy is interested in natural phenomena
when he is willing to spend his leisure time finding out more
about nature’s ways. The only test that we have of an abiding
interest in the welfare of others is the fact that the child
is now active on behalf of others. In like manner are we to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
judge of our success in arousing and maintaining those other
interests which are desirable.</p>

<p>Judgments of fact are called for constantly in acquiring
knowledge and in our everyday activity; but no less important
in the life of individuals are judgments of worth. Education
must concern itself with the ideals, purposes, and standards
which should be acquired by children. There is no field
in which greater skill is demanded in teaching than in bringing
children to appreciate those things which are good, true, and
beautiful. Ideals, or, for those who do not agree with them,
prejudices, will always be of tremendous importance. They
determine the course of action a man will take. Because of
their ideals men have been willing to labor incessantly for a
cause which they considered just, to give up personal good in
the pursuance of public duty, to lose all, if they might but
retain their honor, yes, even to lose their lives because they
felt that this extreme service was demanded of them. The
awakening and nurturing of ideals of work (or industry), of
honor, of duty, of purity, of service is the greatest contribution
of the best teacher.</p>

<p>There is one other aim which the teacher should have constantly
in mind, included possibly in the above, but which
needs to be stated separately for the sake of emphasis, <em>i.e.</em>
that children should be taught how to work independently.
The best teacher is the one who is constantly striving to render
her services unnecessary. There is nothing that the school
can do which will take the place of giving the child knowledge
of the most economical means to be employed in achieving
desirable ends. Is it a matter of knowledge, the child should
be made conscious of the methods whereby truth may be established;
is it the need of establishing a new habit, or the
breaking up of the old one, we should make available for the
pupil the principles of habit formation so that he may apply
them to his own case; in matters of right and wrong, the school
should have supplied standards of reference which will help<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
in the difficult situation. Possibly the great weakness of many
teachers in imparting this knowledge of methods of work is
best illustrated by citing the well-known fact that children of
high school, or even college age, are found very frequently
who do not know how to read a book, or study a lesson assigned.
This problem will be treated in considerable detail when we
come to consider the study lesson.</p>

<p>Pupils at work forming habits of thought, feeling, and action;
acquiring knowledge of nature and of society; forming
ideals which make for social well-being; and learning in all of
this work to act independently, to function in the society of
which they are a part: this is education, and these are the
goals which we should strive to achieve every day and every
hour that we teach.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE FACTORS CONDITIONING THE TEACHING PROCESS</span></h2>


<p>If it is essential that the teacher approach her work with a
clear view of the ends which it is desirable for her to achieve,
it is quite as necessary that she be conscious of the factors
which condition the teaching process. The school, with its
limitations and its advantages, the community and home life
of the child, and, above all else, the child himself, his instincts,
impulses, and abilities must be the subject of most careful
study. Much progress has been made in recent years because
of a better understanding and a more sympathetic attitude
toward children. Teachers are beginning to see that education
has its beginning in, and that it is always conditioned by, the
life of the child outside of the school building. The possibilities
of the school as an institution for the education of children
are just beginning to be realized.</p>

<p>While it is true that the school shares with the home, the
church, and the community at large the education of children,
no one can fail to recognize the fact that the responsibilities
and the activities of the school have been very greatly augmented
during the past few decades. Where other institutions
have lost or have become less effective, the school has gained,
or has been forced to accept new responsibilities. Changed
industrial conditions and life in cities have made it impossible
for the home to continue to hold the important place which it
once occupied in preparing its members for efficient participation
in the productive activities. Whether we like it or not,
we are forced to admit that the church no longer exerts the
power over the lives and conduct of men that it once did.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Along with the specialization of function which is so characteristic
of our modern life, citizenship in our democracy has
come to require less of that type of participation in public
affairs which was once a great educative factor in our community
life.</p>

<p>As these changes in the effectiveness of other institutions
have taken place, men have looked to the schools to make
good the deficiency. The schools have responded to the demand
made upon them. Our curriculum no longer consists of
the three R’s. Cooking, sewing, gardening, and many other
kinds of manual work, music, physical training, and fine art
are already found in our courses of study. We are coming to
recognize the need for more systematic training in morals and
civics, and vocational training is being introduced.</p>

<p>What is the significance of these changes for teachers?
Is it not true that they must teach whatever is demanded by
the course of study; and is not this the only difference in the
teacher’s function brought about by changed conditions? The
answer is, most emphatically, no. The situation which has
already made necessary the change in curriculum demands also
changes in method quite as revolutionary. It is more essential
to-day than ever before that the school present opportunities
for coöperation and for group work, a chance for pupils
to work together for common ends, because there is so much
less demand of this sort made upon children outside of school
than was formerly the case. We ought to do more than we do
to develop the independence and the self-reliance which were so
characteristic of the boy and girl who lived in an environment
which constantly made heavy demands upon their strength,
skill, and ingenuity. The responsibility for taking the initiative,
and of measuring the success of one’s efforts by the results
produced, is all too uncommon in the lives of our children.
The school must, if it is to adequately meet its enlarged responsibility,
develop those habits of thought and action which
enable one to get along with his fellows. The school life of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
child must, in so far as this is possible, present such opportunities,
make such demands, and judge results by standards
essentially social. The child must learn in school to serve, to
accept responsibility, and to produce results socially valuable.
We could do much to increase the efficiency of the school if we
planned more carefully to have schoolroom activities find their
application in the homes of children.</p>

<p>School education begins not with the ignorance of children,
but with their knowledge. Children come to us with a great
wealth of experience. Our work as teachers is to enlarge and
to interpret this experience, to give it greater meaning and
significance. Can any one question, then, the necessity for
acquaintance with the life of the child outside of school?
And this study of the out-of-school environment must continue
as long as the child is in school, if the teacher’s work is to be
most effective. It makes a great deal of difference when you
wish to teach nature study that your children have always
lived in the city, at a considerable distance from a park. The
problem of teaching a great commercial center to children living
on farms presents some difficulty. But it is not alone
these more gross differences in the lives of children which demand
our attention. There are differences in ideals, differences
in social custom, in short, in ways of thinking, feeling,
and acting, which one must know if one would claim any adequate
knowledge of the child to be taught. Probably the best
opportunity to gain this intimate knowledge of the lives of
children whom we teach is to be had in the work with parents
and older brothers and sisters which should be carried on in the
school building when the smaller children are not present. The
school which is a center of community life, a place for study, for
recreation, for physical development, and for social intercourse
is the school that is fulfilling its mission in the life of the
people; and the teacher who works in such a school will know
her children.</p>

<p>There is one other responsibility which we as teachers must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
acknowledge which again leads us beyond the schoolroom. We
should work for the welfare of our children during the time that
they are not with us. No other body of men and women knows
the needs of these children better than we do. Our work is
conditioned by the life of the child before he comes under our
influence. Our work is ofttime of no effect because of the adverse
conditions outside of the school. What does it matter
that we try to develop morality in children, when the forces of
immorality in the streets more than counteract our influence?
what does it matter that we strive earnestly to provide hygienic
conditions for work during five hours of the day, when filth
and disease are doing their deadly work outside of the school for
nineteen hours a day? Who knows better than we that children
with starved bodies cannot do great things intellectually?
If we were only organized to improve these conditions, we could
do much for the welfare of the community. The time is
coming when it will be considered as legitimate for a body of
teachers to discuss the problems of impure food supply, of relief
for the poor, of means for the suppression of vice, and of
better hygienic conditions for the children of our cities, as it is
to discuss the problems of method or the organization of school
work. What we need, if we are to be effective in the work, is
better organization, more craft consciousness. We now possess
potentially great power for social betterment. We are
exercising this power in the school, and, as individuals, outside
of the school. We will, let us hope, in time, recognize the
larger social demand and perform the larger social service.</p>

<p>The children with whom we work come to us equipped with
many native reactions or tendencies to behave. In any situation
the child will react in accordance with some native tendency
or habit which has grown out of the original tendency.
Success in teaching depends upon a recognition of these instinctive
tendencies, the development of some, the grafting
of new but similar reactions on others, and the inhibition of
the native reaction and substitution of another in still other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
cases. The instincts which are of importance in education
have been variously named; among these those of greatest
significance for the work of the teacher are play, constructiveness,
imitation, emulation, pugnacity, curiosity, ownership,
including the collecting instinct, sympathy, wonder. We
shall deal briefly with each of these in relation to the work of
the teacher.</p>

<p><em>Play</em>: Possibly the lesson which teachers need most to
learn is that play has real educative value. Before the school
age has been reached, the child has learned chiefly by playing.
In play the child gets his first experience in those activities
which are later to make possible a happy, useful life in the community.
The number of possible reactions possessed by a
child of six is largely determined by the opportunity he has
had to play. <em>This</em> is why we value so much a life free from
restraint, and in contact with nature, for little children. Contact
with the trees, the rocks, the birds, the flowers, and association
with other children mean possibilities of learning for the
child which no amount of instruction or exercise of authority
can equal. The child plays now with this object and again
with that; and in consequence comes to know not only the
objects, but his own power. In an imaginative way he experiences
all of the adult activities about him, sowing, reaping,
building, cooking, cleaning, hauling, fighting; and he is wiser
and better prepared for the period of struggle, which must
come later, because of these activities.</p>

<p>Nor should this period of play end when the child enters
school. The skillful teacher makes a game of many of the
exercises of the school, which might be otherwise drudgery.
The desire to win is common to children six years of age, and
many a hard task will become play, if the element of competition
is introduced and sufficient variety in procedure is
provided for. By playing, children may learn to work. To
achieve the ends desired in a game may involve the overcoming
of difficulties which require the most earnest effort. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
can be no better preparation for life than the playing of games
where team work, self-restraint, and fairness are demanded.</p>

<p>We need more careful study on the part of teachers of children’s
games, and more planning that all may secure the benefits
which come from this sort of activity. In the schoolroom,
wherever it is possible, the spirit of play should pervade
the work. There will be cases enough where results will depend
upon the exercise of authority. Let us never forget that
the reaction of play may mean just as valuable results as
the reaction of necessity, and that the ideal life is the one in
which all work is play.</p>

<p><em>Constructiveness</em>: Closely connected with the play instinct
is the instinct to make out of the material at one’s command
that which will represent some element in the play. In the
beginning, gestures, sounds, and whatever objects are present
suffice in the make-believe world of the child. But soon the
materials are rearranged or shaped into some new form in order
to represent the object desired. Materials become to the
child just what he can make out of them. And it is not simply
in power to construct or to represent that the child grows
because of this activity. To make something, to work out in
materials one’s idea, means growth in definiteness and control
of ideas. The one adequate test of ideas must always be some
sort of expression; and, for the adult as well as for the child,
construction is one of the most important forms of expression.
We would gain much in all of our school work in clearness and
definiteness, if we resorted oftener to construction as a test.
Of course, construction is not to be limited to the making of
things of three dimensions. The map, plan, or artistic representation
belongs to the same group, and is developed from the
same instinctive tendency.</p>

<p>Just one more word of caution needs to be given with regard
to work of this kind. In constructive work, whether with wood
or clay, or with pencil or brush, the point of departure should
be the child’s idea, not the model or pattern provided by an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
adult. After the child has made his attempt, then let him
see where he has failed by reference to the object which he has
tried to represent. And we can afford to be satisfied in the
beginning with a crude product, so long as it satisfies the child.
As for technique, there will come a time when the desire for a
better product will call for greater skill and will furnish the
very best possible motive for the necessary practice.</p>

<p><em>Imitation</em>: In both play and constructive work a most
important element is the instinct to imitate. The child constantly
imitates adult activities in play, and in construction
he represents the objects about him. As has already been indicated,
it is in this way that he clarifies his ideas, that he gains
experience. In imitation, which is truly instructive, the child
does not consciously plan to imitate; it is enough that the
model is present. This kind of imitation is sometimes called
spontaneous imitation, in contradistinction to the other type
of imitation, in which the individual persistently tries to reproduce
the activity of another. In the latter case he is conscious
of the process; and this type is sometimes called voluntary imitation.
This distinction is important for teachers in many
phases of school work. There are cases where the only satisfactory
response is that which accords with the model, the
standard which society imposes. We do not want a child to
try to spell a word without being conscious of the form commonly
accepted. He will succeed in spelling because he has
studied <em>this</em> word, or is able to build it up from his knowledge
of its constituent parts. On the other hand, wherever creative
work is to be done, wherever originality is required, the educational
value of the exercise is inversely proportioned to the
degree in which conscious imitation of a model has entered
to produce the result. In such subjects as English composition,
constructive work, science work involving observation
and experiment, what we want above all else is the attempt
on the part of the learner to express his own ideas; and it is
only after this expression that any adequate appreciation of
model or of criticism can be hoped for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>There is one other factor in connection with imitation which
is of great importance in teaching; namely, that children persistently
imitate what they admire. This has a double significance
for the teacher. Those things which can be made less
attractive will tend to be less imitated; and, conversely, that
which is held up as worthy of great respect will be much imitated.
If we were only wise, we would devote our attention
to the leader of the group, trying to secure the appropriate or
desired reaction upon his or her part, rather than devoting
ourselves equally to the whole group. We can depend upon
it, the crowd will follow the leader whom they admire. Our
appeals often mean little to children, and the models which we
set up have little effect, because, however admirable these
standards may seem to us, they are beyond the power of children
to comprehend or admire. Instead of giving a boy a letter
of Jefferson as a model, better give him the one written by his
classmate. Do not expect the girl to imitate the noblest
women in history, but make your appeal on the basis of the
virtue of the girl she likes.</p>

<p><em>Emulation</em>: Much that has been said above under imitation
might quite as well have been written under the head of emulation.
As social beings, we tend to do what others do. Consciousness
of kind compels us to lay great store upon our ability
to do as others do. When in Rome the difficult thing is not
to do “as Romans do,” but to do otherwise. The desire to do
not only as well as others, but to accomplish more, is responsible
for much that is achieved in the world. If we did not
have others with whom we are constantly comparing ourselves,
few of us would do as well as we now do. Rivalry will
always be one of the greatest means of bringing about improvement
or advancement in social conditions. In school, as
well as in the world at large, rivalry, if kept free from jealousy
and envy, will justify its existence by the results produced.
The boy or girl who is anxious to distance his fellows in school
is apt to be the man of ambition and of success in later life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p><em>Pugnacity</em>: More prominent in boys than in girls, but present
in some degree in every individual, is the instinct to fight,
the desire not to be overcome either by persons or conditions
which surround us. In so far as this instinct leads to physical
encounter, for all except the unusually strong physically,
the correction comes by way of defeat. For all, the substitution
of games which involve physical prowess for fighting,
and the substitution of victories of intellect for the victories
of physical combat, point to the utilization of this instinct in
education. It is sometimes possible to appeal to this instinct
when discouragement and defeat in school tasks seem
inevitable. No boy likes to be told that he has been downed
by the task in long division, or that he has failed to make good
in spelling or geography. The whole world hates a quitter,
and normal, healthy children are no exception to the rule.</p>

<p><em>Curiosity</em>: Children are proverbially curious about things.
They want to know more, to enlarge and make more definite
their experience. This desire shows itself in their actions in
handling materials, in making and unmaking, in questions
asked, in reasoning, in play, and in imitating others. The most
striking characteristic in the mental life of children is the breadth
of their interests, due to this instinct of curiosity. Most adults
<em>think</em> along very narrow and restricted lines; not so with children.
While it is true that they do little abstract thinking,
there is scarcely an object or an action which comes within the
range of their senses that is not followed by the desire to find
out more.</p>

<p>Children have the spirit of inquiry, have many problems, in
short, are mentally active to a degree most uncommon among
adults. The problem of the teacher is how to keep alive this
spirit of inquiry, how to insure a continuance of this mental
alertness. Much of our school work has certainly tended in
the opposite direction. Reciting what is written in books,
without thought or question, has too often been characteristic of
recitations. The appeal to authority, whether of the teacher or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
of the book, instead of the appeal to experience, to observation
and experiment, or to other methods of establishing truth,
tends to kill rather than to strengthen the spirit of inquiry.
We should place greater value upon the intelligent question
than upon the parrot-like answer. Respect for the problems
of children, even when they seem of little account to us, rather
than ridicule or evasion, will tend to keep alive this most
precious heritage. Of course it is not wise to encourage the
scatter-brained boy or girl who never thinks about the same
thing for two minutes in succession. One great function of
the teacher is to help children to concentrate upon the main
issue, to show a child that his question is irrelevant to the problem
under consideration, and to guide him on the path which
makes thinking pleasant and profitable.</p>

<p>It would be a good thing for every teacher to ask herself
whether while under her direction the children whom she
teaches are usually mentally alert, thinking, asking questions,
or whether they concern themselves only with repeating the
thoughts of others. If there be any doubt with regard to the
children’s natural aptitude, let her observe them when out of
school and contrast the result. Mental laziness is a habit
acquired in spite of our initial advantage, in spite of our desire
for knowledge and the pleasure which comes from thinking.
The school and the teacher must always be judged by their
success in keeping children awake mentally; for it is power to
learn rather than knowledge which counts in later years, and
learning is most of all dependent upon the initial impulses
toward inquiry.</p>

<p><em>Ownership</em>: Very early in the life of the child the idea of
personal ownership develops. There can be no doubt concerning
the importance of this instinct in its effect upon the
achievements of men, but we are concerned chiefly, in dealing
with children, with one aspect of this tendency which is commonly
known as the collecting instinct. This desire to have
the most complete collection of buttons, postage stamps, pictures,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
birds’ eggs, shells, arrowheads, or whatever else it may
be, may often be utilized to great advantage. Illustrative
material for work in history, geography, nature study, and to
some degree for other subjects can be had in this way. Such a
collection will mean not only a much greater interest in the
work, but also a livelier appreciation of the subject, more
images upon which to base its generalizations. I have never
seen a class that learned more geography in a short time than
was mastered by a class who followed the American fleet
around the world, collecting pictures, products, and stamps for
each of the countries visited, and writing a full account of the
country visited to accompany these illustrations. Another
class made most interesting collections in connection with their
study of colonial history. It is a mistake to suppose that ready-made
collections will answer the same purpose. They may
illustrate better, but the added interest and enthusiasm growing
out of the exercise of the collecting instinct will be wanting.</p>

<p>The collecting instinct may be utilized in work which deals
with ideas rather than things. Children may be just as keen
in collecting ideas about a subject in which they are much
interested as in making their collection of stones, or birds.
The transition from the one type of collecting to the other is
apparent, in collections which are interesting mainly for the
ideas which they suggest.</p>

<p><em>The Social Instinct</em>: The school has often overemphasized
the individualistic point of view. Competition is a legitimate
motive; but if all of school life centers around this motive, the
child has lost much in the non-exercise of that peculiarly human
instinct which demands coöperation and sympathy. At the
foundation of our society is the idea of working together for the
common good. Boys and girls who are to be most useful to
their fellows, who are to do the most for society, <em>i.e.</em> those who
are truly educated, must have kept alive and developed this
spirit, more than altruistic, which sees in the good of society
the greatest individual gain. In a later chapter this topic will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
be dealt with in considerable detail; suffice it to say here that
many opportunities should be found for group projects, for
service on the part of each member of the group of the sort
that he is particularly qualified to render.</p>

<p><em>Wonder</em>: The instinct of wonder or awe, closely related to
or possibly identified with the religious instinct, is one that
our modern critically scientific attitude tends to discourage.
No one who has had the experience can doubt the value of this
element in mental life. To wonder at the glory of the heavens
will doubtless make more difference in the lives of most men
and women than the smattering of astronomy they may acquire.
The man who wonders at the manifestation of the power
of the forces of nature may get more real joy out of life than
he who feels that he has solved all of her mysteries. We are
not as a people remarkable for our reverence. It may be
well urged that our schools have often been responsible for the
opposite attitude. This instinct of wonder will thrive only in
a sympathetic atmosphere. No teacher can directly inculcate
or develop it. Only that teacher who has preserved and nurtured
the instinct in her own life can hope to be effective in
keeping alive the same spirit in children.</p>

<p>In the first chapter it was claimed that teachers should work
to develop the socially sympathetic, intelligent, and active
individual, and that the ends to be expected from any exercises
might be classified as habits, knowledge, interests, ideals
or appreciations, and methods of work. In our discussion of
the native reactions of children, we have endeavored to show
that the possibilities of such accomplishment are the common
possession of normal children. It is for the teacher who would
accomplish these ends most economically to discover the instinctive
basis for the habit to be formed, the knowledge to be
acquired, interest to be awakened, or appreciation to be aroused.
The instinctive interests of children will furnish the most powerful
motives, and will serve as a basis for the most lasting results.
Even when the native reaction is undesirable, the successful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
process may depend not merely upon negation, but upon a
grafting upon the original tendency of one that is socially desirable;
or, in other cases, the substitution of another reaction
based upon some other instinctive tendency. We may not
always follow where instinct seems to lead, but we can never
ignore these native tendencies. Whether we blindly ignore or
attempt to work against nature, or wisely utilize the instincts,
the fact remains that all of our work is conditioned by the
native equipment.</p>

<p>It has become more or less the fashion in recent years to
decry the theory of those who discuss the teaching process
from the standpoint of the child’s native tendencies, and with
due regard to his interests. The reactionary who continually
harks back to the good old times is still with us. The term of
ridicule most commonly used in lieu of argument is “soft
pedagogy.” We are told that the only way to develop men
and women of strength is to begin by making sure that we make
our appeal on the basis of our superior authority, or even brute
strength, instead of finding the foundation for our work in the
instinctive curiosity and tendency to mental activity with
which children come to us. It is presumed by those who argue
on the side of the importance of authority that, unless children
are compelled by others to do hard tasks, they will never
attempt anything that involves effort. Again, they interpret
interest to mean the blind following of the child’s instinctive
tendencies.</p>

<p>In our previous discussion we endeavored to show that education
concerns itself quite as much with the inhibition of undesirable
tendencies as with the encouragement of those which
lead to desirable activity. The process is not one of following
where children lead, but rather of availing ourselves of the
native tendencies in order that the ends we desire to achieve
may be accomplished with the least waste of time or energy.
In reality, the choice between the two positions is not whether
we will have regard for childish instincts and capacities, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
rather whether we shall approach our task from the standpoint
of one who has faith in an appeal to the lower motive of fear,
or whether we believe that children are best prepared for later
activity who work out their own problems.</p>

<p>The best teaching can never consist in driving pupils to tasks
which they do not understand and which have little significance
for them. The standard of efficiency is found in ability to
present to the child a need, a purpose, or a problem which
solicits his attention. It may be that we shall be but imperfectly
able to accomplish this result, but, nevertheless, this
must be our ideal. And it is not for reasons of sentiment that
we adopt it. The learning process is explained in this way only.
We make a new adjustment, reconstruct our experience only
in a situation which makes such a demand upon us. When a
child is compelled to do a piece of school work without realizing
the significance of that which he does, there is substituted
for this realization of need or problem an artificial need; namely,
to avoid an unpleasant consequence.</p>

<p>There is another important argument which must not be
overlooked. When a child works under compulsion, he usually
gives just as little attention to his work as may be necessary
to escape painful results. It is not uncommon for children
to divide their attention most skillfully between distasteful
school tasks and the out-of-school activities in which they are
vitally interested. This lack of undivided attention to the
work in hand results in a habit of work which cannot fail to
be disastrous to the highest intellectual attainment. It is
true also that children who have been subjected to such treatment
come to look upon books and lessons as something of a
nightmare, and are only too glad when the opportunity presents
itself to leave school and go to work. The child’s attitude,
growing out of his school experience, is quite as important
as any result which we may achieve in knowledge.</p>

<p>Professor Dewey’s summary of the relation of interest and
effort defines most adequately interest in its true significance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
and indicates the place of effort in educative process. He
<span class="nowrap">says:—</span></p>

<p>“Genuine interest in education is the accompaniment of the
identification, through action, of the self with some object or
idea, because of the necessity of that object or idea for the
maintenance of self-expression. Effort, in the sense in which it
may be opposed to interest, implies a separation between the
self and the fact to be mastered or the task to be performed,
and sets up an habitual division of activities. Externally,
we have mechanical habits with no psychical end or value.
Internally, we have random energy or mind-wandering, a sequence
of ideas with no end at all because not brought to a
focus in action. Interest, in the sense in which it is opposed
to effort, means simply an excitation of the sense organ to give
pleasure, resulting in strain on one side and listlessness on the
other.</p>

<p>“But when we recognize there are certain powers within
the child urgent for development, needing to be acted upon, in
order to secure their own due efficiency and discipline, we have
a firm basis upon which to build. Effort arises normally in
the attempt to give full operation, and thus growth and completion,
to these powers. Adequately to act upon these impulses
involves seriousness, absorption, definiteness of purpose, and
results in formation of steadiness and persistent habit in the
service of worthy ends. But this effort never degenerates into
drudgery, nor mere strain of dead lift, because interest abides—the
self is concerned throughout.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Interest, as Professor Dewey defines it, is intrinsic. The
pupil does his work not because he hopes to escape some punishment
or get a high mark, but because the work of itself
commands his attention. The teacher must constantly choose
whether she will work for interest of this type, which depends
upon the recognition of the worth of the task to be performed,
or resort to an interest which has no relation to the work to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
be done. Shall she appeal to the child through his instinctive
delight in finding out, in constructive work, or other form of
expression, or shall she appeal to his instinct of fear of a whipping
or dislike of ridicule or nagging?</p>

<p>It is true that, after the teacher has done her best to appeal
on the basis of the child’s needs for growth and development,
not all children will respond equally, and so, as in the
larger society outside of school, the child will need to be kept
from interfering with others, and required to do that which
those who are wiser have decided that it is advantageous for
him to do. But this resort to authority, an acknowledgment
of lack of ability on our part or the result of unfavorable conditions,
must come last; it should never be the point of departure.</p>

<p>There is one other distinction which it is well to keep in
mind when we think of interest. Our discussion thus far has
considered interest as a <em>means</em> for securing certain desirable
ends. We may not forget that to secure interest which will
persist in many of the types of activity found in the school
should be considered as an end worthy in itself.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> We may
hope to have a boy interested in his history lesson in order that
he may gain the knowledge contained in this subject. Interest
is the <em>means</em> we employ to secure the desired result.
On the other hand, we may hope that the boy we teach will
continue to be interested in history throughout his life. In
this latter case the interest which we hope to secure in history
becomes an <em>end</em> for which we work. As a result of any system
of education, we are justified in expecting, not only an increase
in the command of facts and in a knowledge of the best method
of procedure in working in subjects taught, but also in hoping
for the development of lasting interests which will make for
a continuance of the period of education and for greater joy
in life.</p>

<p><em>Heredity in Education</em>: An inquiry into opposing theories<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
of heredity is not relevant to our main purpose; but we are
concerned with certain facts, commonly accepted, which condition
our work. No one will dispute the fact that the children
assembled in any schoolroom differ in native capacity, as well
as in experience. Whether genius or its lack are apt to be
reproduced in the children of gifted or dull parents is not the
question the teacher has to solve. For her the demand is
too often that she turn out a uniform product from a group
of individuals who range from the genius to the dullard or
mental defective. It is well for teachers to realize that in any
non-selected group the majority of individuals may be expected
to be of ordinary ability, and that a few will range
above this standard, and a few will fall below. The important
thing to remember is that a group of normal children cannot
be ranged in ability in two or three distinct groups with clearly
defined boundaries, but that if any adequate test be given, we
will find that they distribute themselves over a wide range, with
small rather than large differences between individuals. For
example: if a searching test in fundamental operations of arithmetic
is given, we know that some child will probably get
nearly all of the work done correctly, and, even with our care
in grading, some child in the group will probably fail in more
than half of the work; and that between these two extremes
we will have almost every grade of ability represented, with
a tendency for a considerable number to group themselves at
about that point which we consider ordinary or average ability.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Not only is it true that individuals differ in ability of any
particular sort, but it is also true that the child who has little
ability in one direction may be up to the average or have more
than usual ability in some other direction. In our teaching
we should have a minimum standard of efficiency for all who
are not mentally defective, and we should strive earnestly to
have all reach this goal. If wisely selected, this minimum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
will include that which is absolutely necessary for further
advancement along the line of work pursued. The majority
of the class should achieve results beyond this minimum, and
for the exceptionally bright child the maximum should be
fixed only by the child’s ability and the requirements of good
health. It is useless to attempt to make all alike; it is wrong
to limit the accomplishment of the gifted by the capacity of
the majority; these are the lessons which the consideration of
the capacities of any group of children should teach. We
cannot furnish ability, but we may create an attitude of listlessness
and mental laziness, if we do not give the bright child
enough to do. Education demands a recognition of peculiar
abilities and their nurture. We can never create genius from
mediocre ability, and we may not assume that genius is irrepressible.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE TEACHING PROCESS</span></h2>


<p>Education means change, growth, development. The
process is one of adjustment in which the individual is not only
affected by his environment, but is also capable, in turn, of
changing or even in a measure creating the situation in which
he lives. The experience of any individual grows in meaning
and significance through successive demands for new adjustments.
Among the lower animal forms there are those who
have very little power of adjustment; regardless of the situation
presented, they can react only in one way, or, as the animal
structure increases in complexity, in a very few ways. The
power of adjustment being small, the possibilities of learning
and of education are small. As has already been indicated
in our discussion of instincts, human beings are equipped with
many tendencies to react, and with power to react in a very
great variety of ways. Man has power beyond all other
animals to profit by experience, and is distinguished from them
by his power to learn by means of ideas, not simply by the
process of trial and error. Our problem is, then, to inquire
concerning the conditions under which a situation demands
adjustment, under which experience is reconstructed, and,
further, to discuss the manner in which socially desirable
reactions may be made the permanent possession of the learner,
while those inimical to social welfare are eliminated.</p>

<p>In general adjustments are made in response to one of the
following situations: (1) when satisfaction of some instinctive
need results; (2) when satisfaction of an <em>idea</em> of an end to be
reached, the attainment of which will satisfy some instinctive
or acquired need, results; (3) when satisfaction of an acquired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
need, functioning at the time the adjustment is made, is the
immediate result. In these cases a type of adjustment not
instinctively demanded and not originally in itself pleasing
reaches a point where it is in itself satisfying. The value of
the experience is intrinsic.</p>

<p>Little need be said concerning the first class of adjustments
in addition to our discussion of instincts in the previous chapter.
When one finds himself in a situation which threatens
bodily harm, he instinctively tries to get out of the way. In
the presence of materials, children instinctively handle them,
or make a noise with them, or attempt to construct something.
The schoolboy, with his questions, his collection of stamps,
his adherence to his gang, is making adjustments which satisfy
instinctive needs.</p>

<p>Under the second class are included reactions in which the
satisfaction of the instinctive need is not the immediate result,
and those cases where satisfaction may be explained only by
reference to an acquired need. The essential characteristic
of this class of adjustments is the fact that the idea intervenes.
It is for the satisfaction of our <em>idea</em> of an end which may be
remote for which the adjustment is made. A pupil may try
to read well because he has the idea that reading well pleases
the teacher. The end desired may be simply to get along with
the teacher without the discomfort of a scolding, or because
of his instinctive desire for praise. A boy may labor diligently
in building a sled because of his idea of the pleasure which will
result to himself or possibly to others. A group of children
may save their pennies to buy books, instead of satisfying their
desire for candy, because of their idea of satisfaction to be
derived from the books to be bought. A man may endure
many hardships because of his idea of future wealth, political
preferment, fame, or other good which he hopes will result.</p>

<p>After a time activities which were stimulated by the idea
of a satisfactory end to be achieved may be repeated for their
own sake. This gives us our third class of adjustments. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
boy may find it very difficult to spend five hours a day with
books, while the man finds his chief delight in this form of
activity, altogether aside from a result beyond his present
satisfaction. A child may begin to read because of the authority
of the teacher and his fear of unpleasant consequences,
and yet may later come to find great delight in reading. In
teaching we should strive to bring as many as possible of the
adjustments to be made under this last category. The boy
or girl who finds his greatest satisfaction in making the adjustments,
in gaining the experience, in doing the work that
the school provides, is getting the best possible preparation for
the life of the man or woman who finds his own greatest joy
in his everyday activity. We need not be discouraged because
of the seeming impossibility of the task, since its achievement
would indicate perfection, toward which we strive, and
which, because it is perfection, we never achieve. Adjustments
are to be made, experiences must be had; and our appeal,
whether based upon the satisfaction of instinctive tendencies,
the idea of ends near or remote, or the satisfaction of acquired
needs which are socially advantageous, must be the highest
appeal which can now be made with the assurance that the
resulting reaction will be secured.</p>

<p>There is one point which all of these situations which call
for adjustment have in common; that is, satisfaction. This
fact is fundamental in teaching. Not only are we limited in
our work by native tendencies and capacities, but the results
must give satisfaction, else the reaction induced will tend not
to be repeated. Of course satisfaction or pleasure is a relative
term; possibly it would be fairer to say that the individual
reacts in the way which will result in the least dissatisfaction
or pain. A boy may dislike to write in a copybook, but he
may prefer that to a whipping or to being kept after school.
There is one other possible misconception which must be guarded
against. That which the individual considers most satisfactory
may not be best for his well-being, nor for the welfare of others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
with whom he associates. It is the work of the teacher to
encourage adjustments which are socially desirable, and to
make unpleasant the results which are socially disadvantageous,
even though they originally gave satisfaction to the individual.</p>

<p>Corresponding to the types of adjustment mentioned above
are the types of attention. When the adjustment is made in
response to an instinctive tendency to react, we have what is
called <em>passive</em> or involuntary attention. The boy who looks
at the door when it opens, who makes a paper boat instead of
doing his work in arithmetic, or who talks to his neighbor
about the ball game they are to play after school, is passive so
far as any attempt to control his mental activities is concerned.
He is following the line of least resistance. He does not will
to make these adjustments, or to attend to these things;
hence we say that he attends involuntarily, that he is passive
in the situation.</p>

<p>A second type of attention is that in which the individual
makes an adjustment, follows a given line of activity, voluntarily.
He is active in his determination to accomplish certain
ends, and in order to secure these results he resists the tendency
to wander, to give his attention to other elements in the
situation which may be natively more attractive. This type
of attention we call <em>active</em>. We have this type of attention
wherever the individual works for the satisfaction of his <em>idea</em>
of an end worthy to be accomplished. It corresponds to the
second class of adjustments mentioned above.</p>

<p>Through the exercise of active attention over a considerable
period, the necessity for effort, for the exercise of the will in
order that we may not wander from the main purpose, becomes
less and less, until finally a passive attitude is again
reached. This type of attention is designated as secondary
passive attention.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It corresponds to the third type of adjustments
named above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>In teaching, we begin most frequently with passive attention;
we work most earnestly to secure and to hold active
attention; and if our work is successful, children will reach the
stage of secondary passive attention, at least with reference to
some of the activities found in the school.</p>

<p>In the first grade, in the beginning reading class, the teacher
appeals to the children on the basis of their instinctive delight
in movement, their desire to be like or to excel others, their
pleasure in drawing with pencil or crayon, their love of a good
story, and other like instinctive tendencies to react. The adjustments
made are in response to instinctive needs, and the
attention is largely passive. Gradually, as the work progresses,
the ends to be achieved will become more remote, and instead
of immediate satisfaction of instinctive needs, the children
will work for the satisfaction of their ideas of ends which are
desirable, whether based on instinctive or acquired needs.
They may work diligently in the phonic or word drill because
they have the idea that this must be done in order to read the
story, and the end ultimately to be satisfied may be to give
pleasure to others. The adjustment is made here in response to
the idea of an end to be secured, which represents the satisfaction
of a need which probably has been acquired in the
school or at home. Later in the history of these same children
they may read, overcoming whatever difficulties may present
themselves, simply because this process is for them in itself
worth while. Here we have the adjustment which gives immediate
satisfaction of an acquired need, and the type of attention
which has been designated as secondary passive.</p>

<p>The problem for the teacher is to secure continued attention
to one thing. Almost any exercise which the school offers
will be interesting for a brief time because it is something new.
The difficult task is not to get attention, but to hold it. Children
attend to the situation at hand just as long as it proves
more attractive than some other. The boy who is called inattentive
may be most attentive to the plan he is making to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
earn money to go to the circus. The teacher must endeavor
to discover ends sufficiently attractive to command the active
attention of children for a considerable period. The child
must be willing to exert himself, and the motive for his effort
must be strong enough to bring him back to the task in hand
every time that he tends to wander. Often the success of the
work will depend upon a recognition of the fact that it is very
difficult to attend for any considerable period to a situation
in which the elements do not vary. We may secure continued
concentrated attention by recognizing the fact that variety
in procedure, or in appeal, will make it possible for the child
to keep his attention fixed. Take, for example, a topic in
geography. The teacher will question to bring out different
aspects of a topic, show the children pictures or use illustrative
materials, have children read the map, tell a story or
incident relating to the situation under consideration, and in
this manner keep children actively thinking on one topic for
half an hour. We shall discuss at some length the problem
of aim, in connection with the inductive development lesson.
Suffice to say here that often we fail to secure the continued
attention of children because we ask them to attend to that
which for them lacks interest or significance.</p>

<p>Children work hardest when the problem to be solved is
one that they recognize as their own. They make adjustments
which mean immediate satisfaction, or which they believe will
ultimately give satisfaction. Our difficulty is often that the
end we set up is too remote. The idea of becoming a well
educated man will not ordinarily be powerful enough to keep a
boy at work on a composition, but the desire to be the author of
a paragraph in the school paper, to write to a boy in another
city or country, or to compose part of a drama which the class
will act for their friends, may mean the hardest sort of work, the
most concentrated attention of which he is capable.</p>

<p>The children with whom we work come to us with tendencies
to react, and are capable of reacting in a great variety of ways.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
They learn by making adjustments to a great variety of situations.
The teaching process consists in providing the situations
and the stimuli to action, in guiding the individual in
such a way that the undesirable reactions will be eliminated by
disuse or because the results are unpleasant, in making permanent
desirable native reactions or those which have been
grafted upon or derived from them by making the results
pleasant.</p>

<p>The teaching process is, in general, as described above;
but the actual work of the teacher varies greatly as she strives
now for one end and again for another. There is a methodology
of habit formation which the teacher must command if she is
to do successful work in equipping her pupils with desirable
habits. If our problem is one that lends itself to the inductive
method, we have one sort of procedure; while if the thinking
involved is deductive, certain other elements enter. There is a
kind of work in which we aim primarily for appreciation, and
at another time we are chiefly concerned in teaching children
how to study. The proper conduct of a review or examination,
and the type of exercise commonly known as a recitation lesson,
need to be discussed in some detail. In the chapters which
immediately follow, each of these types of schoolroom exercises
will be considered. Success in teaching consists quite as much
in working definitely for well defined ends which may be accomplished
in this fifteen minutes, this half hour, or during this
week, as in keeping in mind the more general aims of education.
Indeed, the only way in which we can secure the larger ends is
by successfully achieving the lesser tasks. The teacher who
knows that she has fixed this desirable habit of thought, feeling,
or action, that this bit of knowledge has taken its place in a
usable system, that this ideal or purpose has been awakened,
that certain methods of work are available for the group of
children whom she is teaching,—that teacher can be sure
that she is fulfilling her mission.</p>

<p class="p1 noindent"><em>Exercises.</em></p>

<p>1. When a teacher raps her pencil against a desk and the children
look toward her, what is the type of adjustment made? When will they
cease to pay attention to the rap of the pencil? What suggestion would
you offer concerning the danger which may be found in rapping the
pencil against the desk, ringing a bell, clapping the hands, shouting
“be quiet”?</p>

<p>2. Name some exercises in arithmetic in which you may depend
somewhat upon instinctive adjustments to insure progress.</p>

<p>3. Where do you think you will find the most instinctive adjustments,—in
geography, arithmetic, drawing, English composition, or physical
training?</p>

<p>4. A boy who had done poor work in algebra improved greatly when
changed from a class taught by a man to one taught by a woman. How
would you account for the change, taking it for granted that the teachers
were equally competent? What type of adjustment did the boy make?</p>

<p>5. Why is it that any new subject will prove attractive for a short
time, and children will later show a lack of interest in the work?</p>

<p>6. Is there any difference between making a class period interesting
and finding a motive which appeals to children which will lead them to
desire to cover the material which you have assigned?</p>

<p>7. Which is the better, to have a girl study her geography lesson to
please the teacher or to have her at work trying to solve a problem in
which she is interested?</p>

<p>8. What sort of results do teachers secure who compel children to
learn their lessons through fear of being ridiculed or otherwise punished?
If these children know as much as other children whose teacher has them
at work satisfying their idea of pleasure,—which will result in being
able to read well to the class, prepare their part of the class drama, or
investigate in fields in which they are much interested,—would you,
then, consider the first sort of teaching as satisfactory as the second?</p>

<p>9. To what degree can you depend upon the awakening of intellectual
interests to provide a motive for good work on the part of pupils?</p>

<p>10. Do you think the following list of questions would prove intellectually
stimulating to a group of sixth-grade <span class="nowrap">pupils:—</span></p>

<p>“Where is Philadelphia? What is the capital of New York? What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
are the principal rivers of the Middle Atlantic states? Where is Pittsburgh?
For what is Pittsburgh noted? What river forms the eastern
boundary of Pennsylvania? Bound Virginia. Locate the capitals of
the states in this group. Name two valuable products raised near the
coast. Describe the surface of this group of states.”</p>

<p>11. How many children in your class find satisfaction in their school
work sufficient to keep them at it if no marks were given and no one
compelled them to attend school? Are there some subjects or parts of
subjects where you secure this sort of enthusiasm for school work?
Why do you succeed better in these phases of school work than in others?</p>

<p>12. What is wrong with the boy who is quiet during the recitation,
apparently absorbed in the work, but who gets nothing out of it?</p>

<span class="fs80">THE DRILL LESSON</span></h2>


<p>Many responses of thought and action must be reduced
to an automatic basis. It is the function of the drill lesson to
accomplish this result. In some schools this type of work has
been overemphasized, while in others it has been neglected.
It is a mistake to spend the whole of a child’s time and energy
drilling him upon that which some one else has thought. He
must think for himself while a child, if he is to show intellectual
strength as a man. And it is just as much a mistake to
believe that the greatest progress in thought or action can be
achieved without careful attention to the formation of desirable
habits. Probably there is little need to-day to argue
against this conception of teaching, which makes the teacher
simply and solely a drill master. Our respect for the native
tendencies and for the experiences of children, our emphasis
upon doing, our belief that the best preparation for future
efficiency is to be found in present childish efficiency, all refute
any such narrow view of the educative process. There is,
however, in some quarters a danger that this insistence upon
thinking and doing may be construed to mean that drill work
is no longer necessary. There are children who are terribly
handicapped in their later work because they have not learned
to spell common words, to write a legible hand, to give without
hesitation the addition combinations, to reproduce the multiplication
tables, to use without much thought the processes
commonly employed in arithmetic work. They find difficulty
in reading, because they lack that knowledge of phonetics
which would make easy the recognition of unfamiliar words in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
their reading; they stumble in geography, fail in music, lack
ability to comprehend their work in nature study or history,
all because facts essential to further progress, once presented
and understood, were not reduced to an automatic basis by
carefully conducted drill exercises. If it is clear that much of
the knowledge which children acquire must be reduced to the
basis of habit, we may next inquire just how this drill work is
to be related to the other part of the school work.</p>

<p><em>Question of motive</em>: In the formation of habits not provided
for by native tendencies to react, the occasion for making the
adjustment is, as in the case of our thinking, the recognition
of a need. Our first attempts to talk or to use our limbs were
due solely to the compelling force of instinct, but later we
learned a foreign language or achieved success in the high
jump because we had a definite aim in mind. So far as the
teacher is concerned with habit formation, she can hope to
utilize instinctive tendencies, but may not depend upon them
alone to secure the result. A motive must be provided for the
work. The stronger this incentive, the greater will be the
attention given to the work in hand and the sooner will the
desired result be secured. Very much of the drill work which
is done is well-nigh futile because it is imposed upon children.
They do not see its significance, and feel little interest in the
accomplishment of the results demanded.</p>

<p>Ideally, drill lessons should come when the children see that
their future progress is conditioned by successful formation
of the habits involved. And this is not so impossible of accomplishment
as might appear at first sight. If the material
given to children to read in the first grade is of such a nature
that they really care to read it, they are very quick to see that
word drill, and later phonetic drill, will help them to secure
the end desired. Of course the reply may be made: “What
is the use of bothering one’s self with this attempt to make a
rational appeal to children? They will be completely satisfied
if you simply keep them at it. It is a game for them. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
enjoy it simply because they delight in accomplishment.”
One might reply to such a statement by calling to mind the
fact that the school exists to develop rationality. You may be
perfectly sure that frequently enough the children, and later
the men and women, will be driven or led without any appeal
to reason. It will undoubtedly be true that we shall have to
appeal to motives other than rational; but surely this appeal
to reason should be made, and, if our education is successful,
should be increasingly potent as we advance from grade to
grade. Even when a rational motive has been made the point
of departure, we shall have to use many devices to keep alive
the child’s original intention. But let us frankly admit, both
to ourselves and to the children, that these subsidiary aims are
merely aids in helping us to achieve the more worthy aim. If
such a standard of motive were applied throughout our work,
we should probably find it necessary to postpone certain activities
which we insist upon for no reason which a child can
understand, until there was some real use for the habit to be
formed. We might even find ourselves compelled to eliminate
much which finds no application in real life. The occasion for
drill is found in the demand for automatic control of thought or
action, and much of the later success of the children in thinking
and doing will be conditioned by the quality of the work
done in these drill exercises.</p>

<p><em>Knowing what to do</em>: A clear idea of the result to be accomplished
is, of course, involved in the notion or aim as it has
been discussed above. The importance of this element in
habit formation cannot be overemphasized. It may seem
superfluous to call attention to the fact that every child should
have a clear idea of what is to be done before the drill work
begins; but it sometimes happens that the teacher takes too
much for granted. Children stumble and fail, or do nothing
at all, simply because they do not know what it is all about.
It would seem impossible that any group of pupils should be
asked to commit to memory anything which they did not understand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
and yet we are constantly reminded by their later
interpretations that they have not understood. Such logical
organization is not always possible, nor, indeed, even desirable,
as, for example, in learning addition combinations. In such
a case the value of the habit is largely due to the fact that we
no longer attempt to rationalize the process nor attempt to
fix it in a logical series. But whether the task be the memorizing
of a poem, the learning of addition combinations, the
formation of the habit of neatness, or the gaining of skill in
handling a saw, it is essential that the child know just what is
to be done and that he be provided with an adequate motive
for doing it.</p>

<p><em>Repetition with attention</em>: After a child knows what to do,
has the right idea, and the greatest possible motive for doing
has been provided, the teacher’s problem consists in keeping
alive the desire to achieve the result while the process of repetition
is going on. A child learns to spell a word not simply
because he repeats the letters or writes them in the correct order
a hundred times. We all have knowledge of cases in which this
sort of repetition has seemingly resulted in no advancement.
The most economical method of learning to spell requires that
the maximum of attention be given while the letters are repeated.
The story of the boy who, after he had written after
school the phrase “I have gone” a hundred times, wrote at
the bottom of his paper for the information of the teacher, who
had left the room, “I have went home,” is a case in point. The
trouble with this boy was not that he had not repeated the
correct form often enough, but that he had not attended to it.
He had failed to realize the significance of what he was doing.
Doubtless his attention, instead of being fixed on the work in
hand, was more largely given to the game of baseball his companions
were playing, or to the prospect of the delights of the
swimming pool. Much of the concert work that one hears
shows a lack of attention on the part of the larger part of the
class except in so far as is necessary to follow the leaders.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Such work is undoubtedly helpful to those who lead, but it is
of little use to the others who take part. It is a very good
plan to test concert work by listening closely to distinguish
those who are carrying the burden, have them stop, and
measure the success of the work by the result which can then
be had.</p>

<p><em>Means of holding attention</em>: No matter how strong the
motive with which we start, any one of us will grow weary
when the task imposed requires many repetitions. It is even
more difficult for children to keep their attention fixed for
any considerable length of time. We must, therefore, plan
carefully to conduct the drill in such a way that the maximum
of attention may be secured. Among the devices which are
employed, one of the most important is variation in procedure.
Suppose, for example, we wish to spend ten minutes in drilling
children on addition combinations. The best results will not
be secured by spending the whole time in either oral or written
work. Probably the maximum of attention and consequently
of result could be secured by dividing the period into three
parts: one devoted to oral work, holding every one responsible
for every answer; one to written work on a series of problems
provided on number cards or mimeographed sheets; and
one to work of the same sort placed on the blackboard. Of
course there is nothing peculiarly good in the order of exercises
suggested above, beyond the fact that they give variety.
The next day the teacher would want to change the order or
to introduce a new type of exercise.</p>

<p>Another means of securing the maximum of attention is to
place a time limit. Have the children see how many problems
they can solve, how many stanzas they can commit to memory,
or how many words they can learn to spell in a period of ten
minutes. It makes a very great difference whether the teacher
says “work on this task for ten minutes,” or “see how much
you can get done in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>This leads us to consider a third means commonly employed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
to secure earnest work, the appeal to emulation. The desire
of a pupil to do as well as other members of his class, or the
desire of a class to equal the record of another class of the same
grade, will do much to keep attention fixed on the work.
Neither the devices mentioned nor any others will avail unless
the teacher is wide-awake and alert herself. The greatest
single reason for lack of interest and attention on the part of
the class is found in the indifference and lack of energy on the
part of the teacher. It is useless to expect vigorous action on
the part of pupils, when the teacher is half asleep or otherwise
either physically or mentally incapacitated for good work. It
is possible at times for a teacher to arouse her own flagging
interest by just such appeals as have been suggested above as
applying to children.</p>

<p><em>Necessity for accuracy in practice</em>: Our nervous system
is so constructed that to do anything once leaves a tendency
to do the same thing the same way when next we are placed
in a similar situation. It is bad to allow careless work or
random guessing, not simply because the result in this one case
may be wrong, but more especially because the tendency to the
wrong reaction is there and must be overcome before the correct
action can be fixed as a habit. If a child, the day after
he has studied the word <em>foreign</em>, has occasion to write the word
and does not know how to spell it, it is a mistake to permit the
word to be written incorrectly. It would be better to have
the child discover for himself or find out from the teacher the
correct form before attempting to write the word. It is well
to insist on the necessity for absolute accuracy. Better by
far discontinue the drill while every one is still fresh enough
to give close attention to the work in hand and while the responses
are accurate, than to make the serious mistake of
allowing the work to be done carelessly or to flatter one’s self
that approximately accurate results are good enough. Better
be sure that in the drill work on the multiplication table to-day
the children have invariably given the correct response when we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
have asked them how many are six times three and six times
four, than to have attempted to teach the whole table with the
knowledge that one fourth of the answers have been wrong.
We should not be misled; the child who gave us a wrong
answer is not simply wrong this time, but, what for us is
more important, will tend to be wrong ever after. We have
more than doubled the task we set out to accomplish. We
must now get rid of the tendency to give the wrong answer, and
then teach the correct one. In our later consideration of the
moral life of the child, we shall have occasion again to point
out the significance of this principle.</p>

<p><em>The periods elapsing between repetitions or series of repetitions
should be gradually lengthened</em>: The fixing of a habit so that it
shall always thereafter be available to determine our thought
or action requires that we do more than arrive at a point where
the response can be readily secured in a given situation. The
word which your pupils spell so readily, the table which they
recite so glibly, the poem which they have so completely mastered,
will apparently have completely disappeared next week
or next month. Of course the work you have done is not
without effect. It will be easier to learn the word, table, or
poem again. But the child should command these results for
which we labored <em>now</em>. There is a body of knowledge, a group
of actions, which ought to be available automatically at any
time. If we are to succeed in fixing this body of habits, if they
are to be made permanently available, we must recognize the
fact that when we have first secured the result desired we have
only begun the process. The boy who recites Lincoln’s
Gettysburg Address without any mistakes to-day has made a
good beginning; but if that address is worth remembering
always, he must recite it several times during the next week,
and go over it again next month, next term, and next year.
There will come a time, depending upon his native retentiveness
and upon his method of memorizing, when it will no longer
be necessary to repeat it for the sake of fixing the address in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
memory. It will not take a great deal of time to recall that
which we believe we have fixed permanently last week or last
month, and by doing this we shall add greatly to the probability
of possible recall a year or ten years from now, and incidentally
discover, much to our surprise, how much has already
escaped.</p>

<p>Teachers often unconsciously follow the cramming method
in their attempt to have children advance rapidly; and, as is
always the case when this method is employed, what has apparently
been learned is soon forgotten. Fortunately for all concerned,
many of the responses which need to be reduced to an
automatic basis are demanded over and over again as the child
progresses from grade to grade, and are thus provided for.
But much that is now lost could be retained, and each succeeding
teacher could accomplish more than is now customary, if
only this principle of habit formation were commonly observed.</p>

<p><em>In the case of a series of responses to be made automatic, be
careful to include each member of the series</em>: Much of our work
is weak because it lacks system. If we are engaged in teaching
addition combinations, we should be absolutely certain that
we have taught every possible combination. If we want to be
sure that children know how to write numbers up to one million,
we must have given them drill on all of the possible difficulties.
If children are always to respond correctly when
problems involving two steps in reasoning are presented, we
must have been careful to provide for the purpose of drill all
of the combinations of situations involving addition, multiplication,
subtraction, and division which can occur. For any
other similar field, the same care must be exercised.</p>

<p><em>The greater part of the time should be spent in drilling upon
that part of the work which presents special difficulty.</em> There
is no use in spending one’s time equally on all of the words
included in any list. Some of them can probably be spelled
with little or no drill, while others may require very careful
study and many repetitions. In any other field the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
situation will be found. Many of the responses desired will
be reduced to the basis of habit readily, and a few will require
continued attention. It is the function of the teacher to discover
these special difficulties as soon as possible, to clear up
any obscurity in ideas which may stand in the way, and then
to drill with special reference to these special cases.</p>

<p>Briefly summarized, it is the function of the teacher in guiding
pupils in the formation of habits to see to it that they have
the correct idea of the thing to be done; to secure the maximum
of motive and to maintain the maximum of attention during
the process; to guard against carelessness and lapses by
insisting upon the accuracy or the adequacy of the responses;
to provide occasion for repetitions from time to time with
gradually lengthened intervals; to be careful not to omit any
of a group or series of responses equally important; to spend
the greater part of the time and energy of both herself and
pupils upon those cases which present special difficulty.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE INDUCTIVE LESSON</span></h2>


<p>We are skeptical to-day of that sort of teaching which aims
mainly to equip children with a body of accepted knowledge in
order that they may some time find use for this body of information
in later life. We emphasize, rather, the control of mental
activity which makes for the discovery of truth and the avoidance
of error. Thinking of this sort is purposeful. We control
or direct our ideas toward some end, toward the solution of some
problem. One great purpose of teaching must be to provide
the opportunity and the stimulus for this kind of thinking.
We may not be able to lay down any fixed order of procedure,
nor to devise any set of rules whereby children may be trained
to be good reasoners; but we can consider what is involved
in the process, point out the possibilities of interference, and
suggest some of the means to be employed in encouraging this
type of mental activity on the part of children. In this
chapter we shall confine ourselves to that type of reasoning
which we call inductive. This type of schoolroom exercise
has usually been treated as composed of five steps; namely,
preparation, presentation, comparison and abstraction, generalization,
and application. We shall employ this classification
to guide us in our discussion of the process.</p>

<p><em>Preparation</em>: To prepare a child to reason in a given situation
from the data in hand to the conclusions which must of
necessity follow, it is first of all necessary that he should see
that the situation presents a problem. We reason only when
we have some aim or purpose which can be satisfied by the
process. But if consciousness of aim or problem is at the
foundation of this type of thinking, and if we are to deal with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
children in groups, it is essential that the situation which involves
the problem be made the common possession of all.
The step of preparation presents these two problems to the
teacher: (1) to find a basis in experience already had, or to
provide the experience which involves the problem to be considered;
(2) to make the children feel the necessity for the
solution, <em>i.e.</em> to make the problem vital to them.</p>

<p>In considering the necessity for common experience as a
basis for discovering the problem to children, we are dealing
with the principle of apperception. Briefly stated, it is this,—that
any object or situation has meaning for us only as it
connects itself with and is interpreted by our previous experience.
Suppose, for example, that a group of first-grade children
were asked to tell what made seeds grow. It is possible
that some of them would not know, could not interpret from
past experience, the meaning of seeds. If the class were at
work in a large city, we could be sure that many had never been
conscious that growing plants had any connection with seeds,
and there would be few, if any, who had ever noticed the conditions
under which such growth takes place. The first problem
for the teacher in this case would be solved only when, through
recall of past experiences, observations, or experiments, the
experience “seeds growing” became the common possession
of the group. This is an extreme case, one in which the experience
which involves the problem is entirely wanting. At the
other end of the series, we may have a problem for consideration,
the basis for which is found in experiences common to all
children. But even though this be the case, there will still be
need for the recall of the experience and for making prominent
some factor heretofore unnoticed before the children will be
ready to reason. We may suppose that all children have had
experience with streets or roads, but we shall want to recall
many of these experiences in order to make significant the problem
of transportation which we wish to consider in the class
in home geography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>The step of preparation has only partially accomplished
its purpose when the experience necessary to the realization of
the problem has been recalled or provided. Still greater skill
is required in making the child conscious of the problem. Indeed,
it may well be argued that in the curriculum as it is at
present organized, very many of the problems that we ask children
to solve are problems for them only because we, as teachers,
require that that certain piece of work be done. Often
the child’s problem consists mainly in avoiding, as far as possible,
the work which we require, which has little or no significance
for him. Children would do much more thinking if we
were only more careful to give them childish problems to solve.
Too frequently the organization of knowledge which we impose
is influenced exclusively by our adult logical conceptions.
Not that children should be illogical, but rather that child
logic and the child’s ability to reason depend upon his ability
to appreciate problems, upon his experience, and upon his
ability to interpret that experience. When we impose our
adult point of view upon him, when we ask him to take <em>our</em>
problem and with the data that <em>we</em> supply ask him to work out
our solution, whatever else may be said of the exercise, it may
not be called an exercise in reasoning by children.</p>

<p>If we do respect the child’s experience and point of view, the
task still remains of making all of the group of children we
teach conscious of the aim as <em>their</em> problem. There is no greater
test of teaching skill than this. Can the teacher, after having
brought to mind the experiences which are relevant to the work
she wishes the children to do, make them conscious of a lack
in this experience; can she awaken the need for further consideration
of past experience and a desire to reconstruct and
to amplify it? In proportion as she is able to accomplish this
result, we may be sure that children are reasoning upon problems
which are vital to them, and that the motive has been
provided which will secure the maximum of controlled intellectual
activity on their part. The best single test of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
accomplishment of this ideal is to require that the statement
of aim be made by the children themselves as a result of the
guidance we have given. This conception of the meaning and
significance of the aim suggests the solution of the difficulty
which some people find in harmonizing the idea of instruction
with the doctrine of self-activity.</p>

<p>Instruction, when properly conducted, does not impose the
ideas, the problems, or the conclusions of adults upon children.
Rather we are concerned in instruction with the child’s experience,
his tendency to react, his need of adjustment; and our
function as teachers is to guide him, to stimulate him to his
own best efforts, to insure the maximum of self-activity while
we guide this activity toward the accomplishment of ends which
are desirable. The difficulty is, of course, that the problem
for solution at any given time may not be equally vital to
every member of the group. Here is where the element of control
enters somewhat in opposition to the self-activity of the
individual. But this condition of affairs is necessarily true
both in school and out of it, for society sets up for us certain
norms or standards of experience which must be realized by all,
and we must for the sake of economy handle children in groups.
If the problem is not beyond the child’s comprehension, if it
deals with situations which are significant to him, if the solution
derived has some bearing on his future action, if he has
carefully scrutinized his experience in the light of the problem
stated and has brought to bear those elements which are significant
for its solution, we may be confident that the activity
resulting is closely akin to that which is found in the controlled
thinking of men the world over.</p>

<p>In order that it may be more easy for children to focus their
attention upon the problem in hand, there is considerable
advantage in a clear, concise, concrete, and preferably a brief
statement of the aim.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> A problem is half solved when one can
state it clearly. So long as the problem is not sufficiently well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
defined to admit of accurate statement on the part of pupils,
there is danger that there may be much wandering in its consideration.
One of the great lessons to be taught in work of
this sort is the need of examining the ideas as they suggest
themselves to see whether or not they are relevant.</p>

<p>The argument as it has been stated above points to the
statement of aim as the culmination of the step of preparation.
This does not mean that a considerable period must always
elapse in the conduct of an exercise of this type before the aim
can be stated. There are occasions, and when the teaching
has been good they should be frequent, when the lesson should
begin with the statement of the problem discovered in a previous
lesson and made clear in the assignment of work. In
other cases the same aim may hold for several days; <em>i.e.</em> until
the problem is solved. In general, as we advance through the
grades, the ends for which children work should become relatively
more remote, and the achievement of these ends should
require a longer period of work. There is an advantage in
setting up subsidiary aims which will make steps of progress in
the realization of the larger purpose.</p>

<p>Another distinction that it is well to keep in mind concerns
the development of intellectual interests on the part of children.
The characteristic aim for a first-grade child may make
its appeal chiefly to his desire for satisfaction, which has little
intellectual significance; but education fails if it does not make
for an increase of interest in intellectual activity. For example,
a first-grade boy may be led to count because he wants
to be able to tell how many marbles he has, or how to measure
the materials he uses in constructive work; while the mathematician
may work night and day upon a problem of mathematics
because of a purely speculative interest in the result.
We may not hope to produce the great mathematician in the
elementary school, but we may hope after a certain point has
been reached in our study of arithmetic that a boy will recognize
the necessity for drill in addition simply because he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
realizes that in the ordinary affairs of life this knowledge is
required.</p>

<p><em>Presentation</em>: The full realization of the problem to be solved
involves a consideration of data already at hand in experience.
When we have the problem clearly in mind, we examine this
experience more carefully to see what bearing it may have
upon the solution, or we gather further data, observe more
critically or more extensively, or experiment in such a manner
as to involve the solution of our problem. What is the function
of the teacher during this part of the process? There is
no single answer to this question. Sometimes the work of the
teacher will consist almost wholly in helping children to recall
their past experience and to apply it to the question at hand.
At another time, when experience is lacking, the teacher must
direct children to the sources of data, guide them in their
observations or experiments, or even give them outright all
of the data that she can bring to bear on the situation. It will
not always be economical to wait for children to gather the data
for themselves, just as it is not <em>always</em> feasible to require them
to reach conclusions for themselves. There are times when
the best teaching consists in demonstration, and occasions
arise when the only feasible course for the teacher is to literally
flood the children with data from which they may draw
their conclusions.</p>

<p>Again the problem of gathering data becomes the problem
of memory. We want children to think, and we should insist
that they gather facts with reference to the solution of some
problem; but the <em>solution</em> may not always be immediate. We
may suspend judgment while we gather further facts and
organize them. The facts gathered for one purpose, when
rearranged with reference to a new problem, take on a new
meaning. If this be true, we may not in our zeal for clear
thinking neglect the tools with which we work. There may be
some people who have a great many facts and who reason little,
but no one can reason without data. Our ability to think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
logically upon any topic is conditioned by our ability to see
facts in new relations, to reorganize our data with reference
to new problems; but facts we must have, and a memory
stored with facts is one of the greatest aids to thinking.</p>

<p>One of the means mentioned above for the gathering of data
was observation. It is necessary that we appreciate the fact
that observation involves something more than having the
thing present to the senses. Our observations are significant
for our thinking when we have clearly in view the problem
which the observations are to help solve. Teachers sometimes
make the mistake of supposing that when children have
objects with which to work they have a problem. It is not
unusual to hear teachers speak of objective work as concrete
work. Now the concreteness of a situation is not at all dependent
upon the presence of objects. Logically a situation
may be concrete, and yet present no objects to the senses. On
the other hand, objects may be present, children may be
directed to use them, and yet in the absence of any real problem
the work done may be of the most abstract sort. Objects
help to make a situation concrete when the problem under
consideration demands their presence, or when they help to
make clear the situation under consideration. For example,
children may have peas or beans in solving problems in addition;
they serve to present objectively the reality which is
symbolized by the teacher or pupils in their written work,
but this does not make the work in addition concrete. The
concreteness of these exercises will depend upon the need which
children feel of the ability to find the sum of two or more numbers.
The beans will be significant, beyond their use as objects,
to illustrate the one-to-one correspondence between symbolic
representation and reality, only if the problem of summation
which at that time engages their attention concerns the sum
of certain numbers of beans. Indeed, it may be claimed that
the use of one set of objects continuously to illustrate a process
in arithmetic hinders rather than helps the child in his ability<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
to reason in this situation, since he may come to consider this
chance relationship of beans and addition as essential. He
may think that he ought always to add when he is given beans.</p>

<p>A good illustration of the necessity for a well defined problem
for guidance when observations are to be made is found
in the futility of much work that is done, or rather left undone,
when children are taken on excursions. The directions which
follow for the conduct of excursions are those which should
be followed whenever work in observation is required, those
which have reference to the handling of a large group of children
in the field being added.</p>

<p>1. The teacher must have clearly defined in her own mind
the purpose of the observation. If the teacher has not definitely
formulated the problem, the observation of the children
will surely be purposeless.</p>

<p>2. It is not enough that the teacher know just what data
she expects the children to gather toward the solution of a
particular problem; she must know exactly what data are
available under the conditions governing the observation.</p>

<p>3. The preliminary work must have prepared children for
their observations by giving them very definite problems to
solve. Often it will be advantageous to have these problems
written in notebooks.</p>

<p>4. Children not only need to want to see, but also need to
be directed while they are observing. Nothing is easier than
to look and not see that which is essential.</p>

<p>5. It is always advisable to test the success of the observations
while they are being made. There is nothing more
difficult than to correct a misconception growing out of careless
or inadequate observations.</p>

<p>6. It is well to remember that not merely number of observations
counts in the solution of a problem. It is rather
observations under varying conditions which give weight to
our conclusions. One intensive observation may be worth
a thousand careless ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>7. When children are taken on excursions, great care must
be exercised to keep them under proper guidance and control.
The organization of children into smaller groups with leaders
who are made responsible for their proper observance of directions
will help. These leaders should have been over the
ground with the teacher before the excursion. The assistance
of parents, teachers, or of older pupils will at times be necessary.</p>

<p>8. There should be definite work periods during the excursion,
just as in the schoolroom or laboratory.</p>

<p>9. A whistle, as a signal for assembling at one point, will
help in out-of-door work, provided it is clearly understood
that this signal must be obeyed immediately, and under all
circumstances.</p>

<p><em>Comparison and abstraction</em>: With the problem clearly
defined and the data provided, the next step consists of comparison
and the resulting abstraction of the element present in
all of the cases which makes for the solution of the problem.
In the ordinary course of our thinking the sequence is as follows:
We find ourselves in a situation which presents a problem
which demands an adjustment; we make a guess or formulate
an hypothesis which furnishes the basis for our work
in attempting to solve the problem; we gather data in the light
of the hypothesis assumed, which, through comparison and
abstraction, leads us to believe our hypothesis correct or false;
if the hypothesis seems justified by the data gathered, it is
further tested or verified by an appeal to experience; <em>i.e.</em> we
endeavor to see whether our conclusion holds in all cases;
if this test proves satisfactory, we generalize or define; and
lastly this generalization or definition is used as a point of
reference or truth to guide in later thinking or activity.</p>

<p>There is danger that we may overlook the very great importance
of inference in this process. We cannot say just
when this step in the process will be possible, but it is possibly
the most significant of all. A situation presents a problem.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
Our success in solving the problem depends upon our ability
to infer from the facts at our command. Often many inferences
will be necessary before we succeed in finding the one that will
stand the test. Again with the problem in mind we may be
conscious of a great lack of data and may postpone our inference
while we collect the needed information. There is
one fallacy that must be carefully guarded against in dealing
with children, as also with adults; namely, the tendency once
the inference has been made to admit only such data as are
found to support this particular hypothesis.</p>

<p>It is this ability to infer, to formulate a workable hypothesis,
which distinguishes the genius from the man of mediocre ability.
It is the ability to see facts in new relations, the giving of new
meaning to facts which may be the common possession of all,
that characterizes the great thinker. Other people knew many
of the facts; but it took the mind of a Newton to discover
the relationship existing among these data which he formulated
in the law that all bodies attract each other directly in proportion
to their weight and inversely in proportion to the square
of the distance separating them. As we teach children we
should encourage the intelligent guess. We would not, of
course, encourage mere random guessing, which may be engaged
in by children to have something to say or to blind the
teacher. A child who offers a guess or hypothesis should
be asked to give his ground for the inference, should show that
his guess has grown out of his consideration of the data in
hand. It is fallacious to suppose that this kind of thinking
is beyond the power of children. They have been forming
their inferences and testing them in action from the time that
they began to act independently.</p>

<p>There is one element in the consideration of the step of comparison
which cannot be too much emphasized, and that is that
it is not the comparison of things or situations which present
striking likenesses which gives rise to the highest type of thinking.
To look at a dozen horses and then to conclude that all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
horses have four legs is merely a matter of classification; to
observe that the sun, chemical action, electricity, and friction
produce heat, and to arrive at the generalization from these
cases, apparently so unlike, that heat is a mode of motion is
the work of a genius. In general, it is safe to say that we
would greatly strengthen our teaching if we were only more
careful to see to it that our basis for generalization is found
in situations presenting as many variations as possible. For
example, if we want to teach a principle in arithmetic, the way
to fix it and to make it available for further use by our pupils
is not to get a number of problems all of which are alike in form
and statement; but rather we should seek as great a variety
as is possible in the language used or symbols employed that
is compatible with the application of the principle to be taught.
In an interesting article on reasoning in primary arithmetic,
Professor Suzzallo has pointed out the fact that children’s
difficulty in reasoning is often one of language.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The trouble
has been that teachers have always used a set form, or a very
few forms of expression, when they described situations which
involved any one of the arithmetical processes. Later when
the child is called upon to solve a problem involving this
process he does not know which process to apply because he is
unfamiliar with the form of expression used. To succeed in
teaching children when to add involves the presentation of
the situations which call for addition with as great a variation
as is possible, <em>i.e.</em> by using not one form, but all of the words
or phrases which may be used to indicate summation. In like
manner in other fields the examples for comparison will be
valuable in proportion as they present variety rather than uniformity
in those elements which are not essential. Equally
good illustration can be had from any other field. If we want
pupils to get any adequate conception of the function of adjectives,
we should use examples which involve a variety of adjectives
in different parts of sentences. In geography the concept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
“river” will be clear only when the different types of rivers
have been considered and the non-essential elements disregarded.</p>

<p><em>Generalization</em>: When we feel that we have solved the problem,
we are ready to state our generalization. There is considerable
advantage in making such a statement. One can
never be quite sure that he has solved his problem until he
finds himself able to state clearly the results of his thinking.
To attempt to define or to generalize is often to realize the
inadequacy of our thought on the problem. Children should
be encouraged to give their own definition or generalization
before referring to that which is provided by the teacher or the
book. Indeed, the significance of a generalization for further
thinking or later action depends not simply upon one’s ability
to repeat words, but rather upon adequate realization of the
significance of the conclusion reached. The best test of such
comprehension is found in the ability of the pupil to state the
generalization for himself.</p>

<p>There is very great danger, if definitions or generalizations
are given ready-made to children, that they will learn to
juggle with words. The parrot-like repetition of rules of
syntax, or principles of arithmetic, never indicates real grasp
of these subjects. Children think most when the requirement
for thinking is greatest, and none are readier than they to take
advantage of laxness on the part of the teacher in this respect.
It is not only when the formal statement of principles or definitions
is called for that the teacher needs to be on her guard.
At any stage of the process, if the teacher will only take their
words and read meaning into them, some children will be found
ready to substitute words for thought. It is really a mistake
to tell a child that you know what he means even though he
did not say it. Language is the instrument which he employs
in thinking, and, if his statement lacked clearness or definiteness,
the chances are very great that his thinking has failed
in these same particulars. Instead of encouraging children in
loose thinking by accepting any statement offered, it would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
be much better to raise the question of the real significance
of the statement, to inquire just what was meant by the words
used. Such procedure will help to make children more careful
in expressing themselves, and will inevitably tend to
clearer thinking.</p>

<p><em>Application</em>: Whatever conclusions we have reached, whatever
truths we have satisfactorily established, influence us in
our later thought and action. But even though this is true,
there is a decided advantage in providing for a definite application
of the results of the thinking which children have done
as soon as possible and in as many different ways as is feasible.
In the first place, such application makes clearer the truth
itself, and helps to fix it in mind. Again, the conclusion arrived
at to-day is chiefly significant as a basis for our thinking of
to-morrow, and it is as we apply our conclusions that new
problems arise to stimulate us to further thought. Then, too,
the satisfaction which comes when one feels his power over
situations as a result of thinking is the very best possible stimulus
to further intellectual activity. Finally, we need to show
children the application of that which they have learned to
the life which they live outside of the school. We are not apt
to err on the side of too frequent or too varied application of
the generalizations we have led children to make. Rather we
shall have to study diligently to provide enough applications
to fix for the child the habit of verification by an appeal to
experience.</p>

<p>A few words by way of caution concerning the inductive
lesson may not be out of place.</p>

<p><em>First</em>: Not all school work can be undertaken on this general
plan. There are times when the end to be accomplished is
distinctly not the discovery of some new truth, but rather
the fixing of some habit. There are exercises which are distinctively
deductive, some which aim to produce habits, and
others which seek to secure appreciation. But more of this
is in the succeeding chapters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p><em>Second</em>: Even when we seek to establish truth, we cannot
always develop it by an appeal to the experience of children
nor to observations which they can make. We shall have, on
some occasions, to supply the data, and in still other cases it
will be most economical to demonstrate the truth of the position
which we desire to have them take. There are occasions
when the solution of the problem is not possible for children.
In this last instance we shall have to provide the authoritative
statement. Indeed, it may be argued that one of the lessons
which we all need to learn is respect for the expert. We cannot
settle all of the problems which arise, but we may choose
from among those who profess to have found a solution. Our
education ought to help us to avoid the quack and the charlatan.
The habit of logical thinking on the part of children,
and expert knowledge in some field, however small, is the only
protection which the school can give against the pretensions
of those who represent themselves as the dispensers of truth.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><em>Third</em>: There is a grave danger that we may help children
too much. Some teachers interpret the inductive development
lesson to mean that each step in the thinking required must
be carefully prepared for and quickly passed. They consider
that they have taught the best lesson when there has been no
hitch in the progress from the statement of aim to the wording
of the generalization. The suggestive question which makes
thinking on the part of children unnecessary is a favorite
measure employed. If we stop to consider what thinking
means, we cannot fail to see the fallacy of such work. We all
do our best thinking, not when the problem to be solved is
explained by some one else and all of the difficulties removed,
but rather when we find the problem most difficult of solution.</p>

<p>If children are at work on problems which are vital to them,
we may expect them to continue to work even though they
make mistakes. Indeed, the best recitation may be the one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
that leaves the children not with a solution skillfully supplied
for them by the teacher, but rather with a keen realization of
the problem, and with a somewhat clearer idea of the direction
in which the solution may be sought. It is the teacher’s work
to help the child to see the problem, and, seeing the problem
herself from the child’s point of view, to stimulate the child to
his best effort. The teacher must know not only the pupil’s
attitude of mind toward the problem and how his mind is most
likely to react, but also the mental activity required to master
properly the issue that has been raised. On the one hand, the
teacher’s equipment consists of a knowledge of the minds of the
children whom she teaches, and on the other a knowledge of the
subject to be taught, not simply as a body of knowledge more or
less classified or organized, but as a mode of mental growth.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
What the teacher needs is a clear realization of the difficulties
which the pupils must meet, and the way in which childish
minds may best overcome these obstacles. When such sympathy
exists between teacher and pupil, we may expect that
pupils will constantly grow stronger in their ability to think
logically, instead of becoming more and more dependent
upon the teacher. And this is our great work as teachers, to
render our services unnecessary.</p>

<p><em>Fourth</em>: No teacher should attempt to outline her work on
the basis of the steps indicated in the discussion of the inductive
method without a clear realization of the fact that these
steps cannot be sharply differentiated, that they are not mutually
exclusive. To define a problem adequately may mean that
we have passed through the whole process. At any step in the
process after the problem is defined, and some hypothesis
formed, we may wish to verify our guess by an appeal to known
facts, and often we shall find it necessary to abandon the
hypothesis already formed and provide another as a basis for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
further thinking. It is true that the natural movement of the
mind is roughly indicated by the steps named; but it must be
remembered that no mind can possibly arrive at the solution of
a real problem by adhering to a fixed order of procedure. We
do not by our teaching create the power of logical thought;
we rather guide a mind that naturally operates logically. We
can never teach children to reason, but we can provide the
occasion for logical thinking, and can guard against the common
fallacies. Our success will depend upon a clear realization
of the possibilities of the child mind and of the subjects
we teach as part of their growth and development.</p>

<p><em>Teaching by Types</em>: Teaching by means of types is sometimes
discussed as a separate method, while in reality it is simply one
form of the inductive process. As was indicated in our discussion
of observation above, there are times when the consideration
of a single situation or object in detail may be worth
more than a thousand careless observations. It is especially
true that a thoroughly adequate knowledge of one object or
case of a class prepares in the best possible way for future
observations of members of the same class. Familiarity with
the life history of one animal or plant will help us greatly to
understand other animals and plants, because that which is
most essential in all has been carefully observed in the case
considered. Now let us suppose that several plants and animals
have been studied. If the cases which are considered are truly
typical, it may be possible for the student to appreciate not
simply the individuals belonging to the classes studied, but
also something of the interrelation of the several classes. This
illustration, given because it represents in a general way
something of the method followed in the study of science,
represents a very common method of procedure in the ordinary
affairs of life. None of us can hope to support our conclusions
by a careful scrutiny of all possible cases. We take something
on authority; namely, that the individual case considered is
representative of a large group, then after we have investigated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
the one case we apply our conclusions to the whole group. Of
course there is one great danger. We may be overhasty in
our generalizations. No fallacy is more common than the
emphasis placed upon non-essentials by those whose observations
have been limited. The stories of the traveler who
generalizes, after seeing one red-headed child or after eating at
one hotel, concerning the children and hotels of the country
visited, are too common to need repetition here. Where observations
are necessarily limited, the important consideration
is to get cases that seem as different as possible in order that
that which is essential may be differentiated from the non-essential
or accidental.</p>

<p>Teaching by types in our ordinary school work has been
applied most frequently to the subject of geography. Applying
the principle stated above, we shall be careful in teaching
rivers, mountains, cities, commerce, or any other geographical
notion to see to it that the individual cases considered are as
widely different as possible. To teach New York City, Philadelphia,
and Chicago only would give children a very erroneous
idea of the concept “city.” They are all exceptionally large,
all American, all modern. There are cities smaller, with
peculiarities due to age, to location, and to the ideas and resources
of the people building them. A better selection would
be New York City, London, Tokyo, Venice, Cairo, and Munich.
Objection could still very well be offered that this list is too
short to include all classes. There can be no doubt that to
have taught any city carefully will aid greatly in understanding
the notion “city” and in appreciating other cities, but manifestly
any final generalization concerning cities must wait until
our knowledge of geography has been widely extended. The
same conclusion would be reached were any other notion of
geography, or any other study, subjected to the same test.
There is, however, no harm in forming tentative judgments.
Indeed, we must all do this every day of our lives. The main
issue is to see to it that there is no mistake as to the tentative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
character of the conclusions reached, that the open-minded
attitude be preserved.</p>

you took to a cattle ranch, show them pictures, and possibly read a

<span class="fs80">THE DEDUCTIVE LESSON</span></h2>


<p>The complete process of thought involves both induction
and deduction. Every general principle, unless it is self-evident,
must either be arrived at through the process of induction,
or be accepted without any attempt at verification.
Having formed our generalizations, we use them as a basis for
further thinking. If we find that the principle always holds,
we are satisfied with its validity. In this testing of the generalization
tentatively made, the process of thought is deductive.
The fact is that in the process which we designate as induction,
deduction enters to verify our inference. In the face of the
problem which can be settled only by reference to some established
principle, we find ourselves questioning the generalizations
formerly accepted, and the process of thought in solving
our problem will involve induction as well as deduction. For
convenience we treat the problems of teaching under the two
heads, the inductive and the deductive lesson, according as
one or the other type of thought seems to predominate in
reasoning required to solve the problem involved.</p>

<p>Every one thinks deductively who has had sufficient experience
to form any generalizations. In the early life of the
child we find the psychological basis for deduction in the tendency
to act in accordance with ideas. Children define things
in terms of their function. Thus a hat is something to wear
on the head; a drawer something to pull out and push in;
a shovel something to move the sand with; and so for the other
objects in the child world. A child makes a dog in clay, draws
a picture of a flower, makes a house of his blocks—and in this
way tests his ideas. Not all deductive thinking ends in motor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
activity; but we can never be satisfied with our deductions
until we have established them experimentally. The question
concerning our ideas always is, will they work?</p>

<p>Whenever we offer an explanation of our ideas or of our
actions, the process of thought is deductive. Not that either
adults or children often state the general principle upon which
they base their statement or action. We are all only too prone
to assume the general principle. The foolish answers which
children give may be logical enough. From his very limited
experience a boy may have generalized that grass is something
to look at and not to be walked on, and that people always live
in houses from four to ten stories high, with many families
in a house. Now, if such erroneous generalizations have been
developed, the way to handle the boy is not to laugh at his deductions
from these premises, but rather to require him to state
the generalizations upon which he has based his thinking, and
to lead him to discover their inadequacy. It matters not what
group of children one works with, this same need for a declaration
of the principle upon which the argument is based, the
generalization which covers the situation under consideration,
will be found essential. That teacher does much for the children
who frequently pushes them back to a statement of what
they assume to be true. This statement is not always easy
to make. Even with adults it is very common to explain action
by reference to some feeling or attitude which it is assumed has
some basis in reason. Some instinctive tendency, or a mode of
feeling, thinking, or acting which has become habitual, frequently
explains, but fails to justify our actions. The ability
to state clearly what one assumes, and to claim as valid only
such conclusions as are based on premises which are admitted
to be true, is the mark of the man of unusual rationality.</p>

<p>There is no set of rules which a teacher may follow in order
to make the children she teaches logically minded. On the
other hand, all of her activity tends in some degree to encourage
or to eliminate the logical habit of mind. The teacher who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
dogmatizes continually in her teaching can do little to overcome
a like tendency in the children by conducting exercises
logically correct. The wrong emphasis on correctness of the
result, instead of correctness of the method employed in getting
the result, encourages much illogical work and develops careless
habits of thought. And it is just as true that an open-minded
attitude on the part of the teacher will be reflected
in the children. The teacher who insists upon the verification
of generalizations, who asks children frequently to give the
ground for the statements which they make, and who encourages
reflection, will engender logical habits of thought.</p>

<p>To recognize the wide application of the deductive method in
our thinking, one has only to consider what is meant by reflection.
It is well also in this connection to remember that the
habit of reflection distinguishes the educated from the uneducated
man. It is not the number of experiences which makes
the difference between men, but rather the use that has been
made of those experiences. When we reflect, we think over,
organize, and relate our past experiences. Suppose, for example,
that some one makes the statement that corporal punishment
should be banished from all schools. If you reflect
upon such a thesis, you bring to bear your experiences, whether
of action, observation, or thought stimulated by reading what
some one else has said; and, as a result of your thinking, you
consciously or unconsciously assume a general principle under
which you feel satisfied that this question of discipline falls;
and then you will refer all of your experiences to this principle,
testing its validity by seeing whether or not it does uniformly
hold. The process of thinking which you have employed is
essentially deductive. If stated in the form of a syllogism, it
might be expressed somewhat as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<p>1. Any action which tends to brutalize either pupil or teacher
should not be permitted in any school.</p>

<p>2. Corporal punishment tends to brutalize both teacher and
pupil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>3. Hence corporal punishment should be banished from all
schools.</p>

<p>The process of thought employed has led you to search for a
general principle which you accept as true and which offers an
explanation of the position which you take in agreeing that
corporal punishment should be banished. If you are really
reflecting, you will not stop with this reference to a generalization
apparently true. Rather you will inquire whether in your
experience the infliction of corporal punishment has tended to
brutalize you. You will also ask yourself whether this is true
of others, and to what degree. You will recall specific cases of
punishment of this sort, and will try to decide whether the disadvantages
or evil outweighed the good. Only after such careful
thought is the process of reflection complete, and it is only
then that you can feel satisfied of the soundness of the position
which you have taken. It will be noted that the process of
thought has been both inductive and deductive.</p>

<p>If children are to learn to reflect, they must have leisure to
think over their past experiences. There is danger that in our
desire for more knowledge and more activity on the part of
our pupils, we may give them little time for reflection. To ask
a child to state the significance of what he has done, to encourage
him to examine every assumed truth in the light of his
experience, and to state somewhat formally the result of his
reflection is worth much more than the new experiences which
might have been gained in the same length of time. The habit
of reflection will be developed only when sufficient time is
given for children to stop and take account of the experience
which they have had, when respect is accorded the experiences
of the individual, and when the teacher requires such work and
guides children in the process.</p>

<p>An attempt has been made in the preceding pages to indicate
in a general way the significance of the deductive method in
our school work. It remains to indicate briefly the method of
procedure in the conduct of class exercises which are essentially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
deductive in their nature. Such exercises will be found in any
subject in which there is developed a body of general principles.
For example, the real test of a pupil’s knowledge of a principle
of arithmetic is found, not in familiarity with the process of
induction by which the principle is derived, nor in his ability
to apply this principle to the problems given in the book, immediately
following the rule, all of which fit the generalization, but
rather in his ability, when a miscellaneous list of problems is
given, to pick out the principle which applies to this one case.
The test of one’s knowledge of geography is found not simply
in the facts which he knows, but also in his ability to explain
phenomena or to anticipate situations by reference to a body
of general principles.</p>

<p><em>The problem</em>: From what has already been said it is clear
that in deductive thinking, as well as when the process is inductive,
the occasion for thought is found in a problem to be solved.
We wish to know why a certain region is arid or what the possibilities
of agriculture are in another, and we, therefore, recall our
knowledge of the principles of geography in order to solve our
problem. A moral situation confronts us; we need to act; and
in response to this necessity we endeavor to refer the situation
to some norm or standard of conduct which we accept as fundamental.
The success of our work in securing clear thinking
by children will always be conditioned by our success in enabling
them to realize the significance of the problem presented for
solution.</p>

<p><em>Finding the generalization or principles</em> which fit the situation
to be accounted for or explained is the next step. In order
to accomplish this part of the process successfully one must be
able to discover that which is essential and to neglect the non-essential
in the problem to be solved. Suppose, for example, that
the problem is: Why has the greater part of Africa not been
settled by civilized men? The factor which is significant is the
climate of this region, and it will be of no use for the pupil to
recall the size of the continent, the color of its inhabitants, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
fact that Livingstone made a journey across it, except that by
eliminating these facts he may be brought to realize that none
of them determine the situation, and hence he need no longer
pay any attention to them. It is the function of the teacher
to suggest to the pupil a number of alternatives and then to
guide him in his search for the determining factor. For
example, the teacher might ask: Is it because of the savage
inhabitants, because of a lack of means of transportation, because
the country is overrun by dangerous wild animals, or because
of climate? Each of these classes of facts may be known
to the pupils, and each in turn may be eliminated as non-determining
factors until he comes finally to the last. He must
then, provided he decides that climate may determine the
availability of a region as a habitation for civilized man, discover
under what condition of climate civilized man fails to
make advance. He has thus fitted his situation, his problem,
to the generalization under which it falls, and has, in fact, taken
the next step in the process.</p>

<p><em>Inference</em>: The inference that the greater part of Africa is
not inhabited by civilized men because of adverse climatic
conditions is arrived at just as soon as the pupil settles upon
climate as the essential factor. Just as in the inductive
process we pass immediately from the step of comparison and
abstraction to the statement of the generalization, so in the
deductive lesson, when once we have related the particular case
under consideration to the principle which explains the situation,
we are ready to state our inference. There is real value
in making such a statement. The further process of verification
depends upon a clear and definite statement of the inference;
and the best test we have of the completion of the preceding
step is the ability which the pupil shows to state his
inference.</p>

<p><em>Verification</em>: When the inference has been made, we have
yet to satisfy ourselves concerning the validity of our reasoning
by an appeal to known facts. Following the illustration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
already used, we should ask ourselves what has happened in the
past to civilized men who have gone to Central Africa. We will
be satisfied that our reasoning has been correct, only if all of the
facts we are able to discover point unmistakably to the conclusion
that the climate of the larger part of Africa is unendurable
by civilized men.</p>

<p>The element which needs most emphasis in deductive teaching
is the realization on the part of the teacher that the success
of the process is directly proportional to the independence with
which the pupil discovers for himself that which is essential in
the situation under consideration, his attempt to fit or relate
the particular case to the principle or generalization by which
it will be explained, and his willingness, when he discovers his
error by an attempted verification, to repeat the process. We
do not think logically by having some one else do our thinking
for us, nor is our growth measured by the uniformity with which
we hit upon the correct solution of the problem at the first
attempt. Rather we may measure success by the power of our
pupils to criticize the reasoning which appears plausible until
carefully scrutinized, and by their readiness to retrace their
steps and to search for firmer ground when they have of their
own accord given up a scheme of reasoning which has proved
invalid.</p>

<span class="fs80">LESSON FOR APPRECIATION</span></h2>


<p>Education aims not only to enable one to avoid error, to
discover truth, and to equip him with desirable habits, but also
to develop the power to appreciate and to enjoy that which is
beautiful, whether in literature, painting, sculpture, art, or
music. It is not enough that a man be able to make a living;
he ought, as a result of his education, to be able to enjoy life.
Matthew Arnold’s definition of culture, “the acquainting ourselves
with the best that has been known and said in the
world,” embodies much that is essential in modern education.
The ability to enjoy a drama of Shakespeare, a picture of
Millet, or an opera of Wagner, means the possibility of noble
pleasure, of leisure time spent in such a way that inspiration
and strength, instead of possible waste, or, even worse, degradation
and weakness, result. It is, then, a vital part of our
school work to give opportunity for and to encourage in every
way possible the development of power of appreciation.</p>

<p>Some of our schoolroom exercises ought to aim primarily
to develop power of appreciation in the several fields mentioned
above. Not that appreciation can be taught directly,
but because there are conditions which are negative in their
influence. No one will ever learn to appreciate music or literature
or art because some one tells him that he ought and that
this is worthy and that unworthy. This sort of teaching will
result in hypocrisy and cant. On the other hand, the best
guarantee of development along these lines is found in association
with those who do genuinely appreciate. It is in this
fact that we find our first suggestion for work of this kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>Do not try to teach any one else to enjoy that which you
do not fully appreciate yourself. The fundamental qualification
for the teacher is power to appreciate. She must enjoy
to the full that which she hopes to make appear beautiful in
the eyes of her pupils. It is useless to ask children to enjoy
one of Stevenson’s child rhymes, if you find yourself unable
to enter into the spirit of the poem. Pictures may be hung
on the wall and religiously taught; but children will not want
to buy good pictures, nor are they apt to frequent the art
galleries, unless they have associated with those for whom
pictures are a genuine source of pleasure. The best preparation
for the teacher who feels that her teaching is inadequate
in those phases of her work which involve appreciation is to
plan to do what she can to insure her own growth in this particular.
Read more poetry, and especially read it with those
who derive great pleasure therefrom, if you wish to teach poetry
better. If you are familiar with the great musicians, and have
through your acquaintance with their work developed some
measure of appreciation for this type of expression and for the
method by which the musician has been able to build up his
wonderful composition, then you may rest assured that your
pupils will not find music uninteresting.</p>

<p>The question most frequently asked concerning the teaching
of those subjects in which we seek to develop appreciation is
whether one must command the technique involved in creation
in order to grow in power to enjoy the work of the masters.
For example, must one be able to read music in order to appreciate
music; must one be able to state the rhetorical excellence
of Stevenson’s narratives in order to enjoy his stories;
is it essential that one fully appreciate the technique of painting
in order to get the most out of Corot? In general, the answer
is that such knowledge of technique may either help or
hinder one in his actual power of appreciation. It will hinder,
if the consideration of technique is constantly uppermost in
one’s mind; it will help in so far as knowledge of technique<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
gives one the feeling of excellence or perfection of form, provided
always that it is this beauty of the product which most
engages the attention, and that interest in technique is subsidiary.
To express the same idea in another way: if one’s
knowledge of technique makes him overcritical or oversensitive,
he is apt to lose all enjoyment in his concentration upon
the technique, in looking for weaknesses, or in his feeling of
discomfort because of imperfection. What significance, it
may be asked, has this for our teaching? Mainly this, that
we must remember that appreciation is in large measure a
matter of the emotions, and that any attempt to overintellectualize
the process will defeat the end we desire to secure.</p>

<p>There is no other kind of work in which the attitude of the
individual at the beginning of the exercise is as important.
There is a story told of a teacher who wished to teach a beautiful
poem, the burden of which was the beauty of kindness to
birds. She began with the birds that the children knew—sparrows.
In a short time the children developed the notion,
and very justly, that sparrows were a pest, that they had driven
away our song birds, and that it would be a good thing to exterminate
them. The children were ready to go forth to the
slaughter; and then came the poem with its admonition to
kindness toward birds. These children would, of course,
have been more impressed had this preparatory work been
omitted entirely. Very frequently for work of this kind, the
very best preparation is found in placing children directly in
contact with that which you hope to have them appreciate.
Read the poem, play the music, expose the picture to view, and
allow them to do their work. Later a somewhat more detailed
treatment, possibly involving many repetitions, will give opportunity
for increased appreciation.</p>

<p>Children should not be forced to give expression to the feeling
awakened. The teacher may accept gladly such expression
as comes spontaneously. She may at times ask for a selection
of the part most enjoyed. Especially to be avoided are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
expressions such as: “Don’t you think this beautiful?”
“Don’t you enjoy this?” and the like. Children under such
stimulation are apt to say that they enjoy whether they do or
not. They are just as anxious to do the right thing as are some
of their elders. To be constantly directed, always told what to
admire, means lack of confidence in one’s own ability to judge
of excellence, or, even worse, the attitude of the hypocrite
who admires that which he thinks it fashionable to favor. It is
probably safer to judge of the success of work of this kind by the
expression on the faces of the children than by the words you
may persuade them to use.</p>

<p>In a lesson of this type the teacher does the best work when she
acts as interpreter. Success depends not so much upon initiative
on the part of the children as upon the ability of the teacher
to sympathize with the childish point of view, and to lead them
to greater heights by the force of suggestion growing out of her
own joy in that which she presents. It is by voice, by gesture,
by suggestion, and by explanation,—in all, by providing the most
favorable opportunity possible for appreciation, keeping herself
as much as possible in the background,—that the teacher makes
provision for the development of this power by children.</p>

<p>Much is gained in power of appreciation by giving opportunity
for creative work on the part of children. The group
of children who have composed a song, and who have labored
diligently to make the music which they have written fit the
spirit and rhythm of the words, will find a new meaning in the
lullaby which they are asked to learn to-morrow. Music will
mean so much more than pitch, time, notes of different value,
and the like. Through their own attempt they will have realized
in the best possible way the fact that the music of the
song is intended to express feeling in harmony with the words
that they sing. The child who has attempted to draw a landscape
will by virtue of that fact grow in power to enjoy the
landscape placed on the wall for his enjoyment. And so for
any other field in which we seek to develop power of appreciation;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
to attempt to create for himself will give the child a better
understanding of the elements which go to make up excellence,
and the contrast between his own effort and that of the
master will greatly enhance the value of the latter in his eyes.</p>

<p>Thus far in our discussions of the lesson for appreciation we
have interpreted it to mean the development of the æsthetic
emotions. There is another sort of appreciation which involves
rather more of the intellectual element, but which, so far as
teaching method is concerned, may probably be treated to
greatest advantage in this same connection. Indeed, there
are cases, as in literature, where both elements are involved.
In the study of a drama of Shakespeare we are concerned not
only with the beauty of expression, but quite as much with the
portrayal of the lives of men and women as they have acted and
reacted on each other in their common environment. In history
we have this drama extended to include a nation or the
nations of the world in their relations to each other. In either
case we have the record of cause and effect, an account of social
experience fundamentally akin to our own. Appreciation
here involves the ability to follow the logical relations which are
recorded. In proportion as one becomes aware of the motives
which have actuated men, the relationships which have
existed among them, the organization and outcome of their
activities, he has widened his own experience. This possibility
of a vicarious extension of the child’s social experience is
one of the reasons for giving history and literature a place in
our school curriculum.</p>

<p>Let us inquire what is involved in securing appreciation of
this type. Take, for example, the appreciation of the period
just preceding the Civil War. How are we to understand this
remote situation? We cannot observe directly; we cannot, as
is the case in the solution of a problem in our present experience,
gather data by means of observation; nor can we test
our conclusions by experiment. Our first great need is to have
presented all of the facts possible. We may read the historian’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
account, or have it read to us; we may get hold of the
newspapers published at that time; read the debates which
took place in Congress; peruse the letters of men and women
who lived and wrote at that time; make inquiry concerning
the number of slaves, and the value of the Southern plantations
worked by them; try to find out why slavery had been abolished
in the North, and by every means possible familiarize
ourselves with what men said and did and the conditions under
which they worked at that time. We must have this material
made accessible to the children through books or by word of
mouth before we ask them to follow the logical relations established
among these facts by the historian. Appreciation has
its beginning in the abundance of data supplied which makes
possible the imagery with which the children are to work, and
is consummated when the child has, through his own efforts and
by following the development of another, come to understand
the play of cause and effect, the organization and relationship
existing among these human activities. Work of this sort
has in the last step something in common with the inductive
lesson, but with this difference, that the children are in the main
concerned with appreciation of facts and of the relationships
established among them by some one else, presumably the
expert historian. It is more a matter of understanding than
the discovery of new truth. Of course, there are lessons in history
in which the problem is just as distinct as in any science,
and where the work can be best described as inductive or
deductive reasoning.</p>

<p>And so likewise for literature. The author presents the
situation, and draws his conclusions, supposedly true to the
logic of human action. The teacher may need to supply details
which are missing, may need to guide the children in their
attempt to follow the interpretation of the author, but it must
be mainly interpretation of facts provided; and presumably,
if great literature is studied, the appreciation of the author’s
interpretation of the human relations is of vastly greater importance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
than the attempt at interpretation which the children
may make.</p>

<p>Appreciation does not mean quiescence,—far from it. Neither
does it concern itself primarily with the discovery of new truth
or excellence. Rather we aim to understand, and to enjoy,
when the æsthetic emotions are involved, the work of the masters.
If we can, even in some degree, lead children to think
their thoughts, to interpret human activity and human feeling
as they have interpreted it, we shall have most signally widened
and enriched their experience, and shall have made available
for them for all their lives a source of recreation and enjoyment,
a storehouse of wisdom, which may constitute their greatest
indebtedness to our efforts in their behalf.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE STUDY LESSON</span></h2>


<p>That it is the main business of the teacher to render her
services unnecessary cannot be too often reiterated. To be
able to reason clearly one’s self; to have control of one’s
habits; in short, to know how to use one’s energies to best
advantage when the problems of life are encountered, is the
greatest benefit to be derived from education. We shall concern
ourselves in this discussion with study as it involves controlled
thinking, whether inductive or deductive; with the
most economical method of making knowledge more available
for use by increasing the possibility of recall; and with the
possibility of reducing certain knowledge or responses, whether
physical or mental, to the basis of habit.</p>

<p>In general, our problem in teaching children to study consists
in making them conscious of the best methods to be employed
in logical thinking, or in the formation of habits, and
then in giving sufficient practice in the use of these methods to
make them the habitual manner of reaction, as far as this is
possible. It is true, of course, that one who applies the logical
method to a question of mathematics or geography may be
swayed by prejudice when the question concerns politics or
religion; and that the man who knows best how to form
desirable habits may be so bound by some other that he will
fail to achieve that which he knows to be desirable. Be this
as it may, if the school makes the child conscious of the most
economical methods of work, the chances for later efficiency
are greatly increased.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, what we have been prone to call good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
teaching has not always accomplished this desired result. It
has too often happened that the direction and help offered by
the teacher have tended to make the child dependent, utterly
unable to do a piece of work for himself. Even when children
have supposedly been required to do much thinking, the teacher
has sometimes weakened her work by continually stepping in
to propose the next step whenever a critical point has been
reached. The argument which proves conclusively that children
do not learn to work independently is found in their
inability in the upper grades, in the high school, and even in
the college to use their time to good advantage.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>In teaching children how to study, the first step involves
a clear statement of the problem to be solved. The teacher
who says “take the next five pages” cannot expect that the
children will do anything more, so far as learning how to study
is concerned, than waste time in fulfilling her demands. We
think hard when we have a problem to solve. If it be true
that children need to have an aim clearly in mind when they
are at work with the teacher, it is much more essential that
they should have clearly in mind the goal toward which they
are striving when they work alone. Whenever children are
expected to do any work at their seats or at home, the type
of assignment becomes a determining factor. It is a mistake
to suppose that a minute or two at the end of a recitation will
be sufficient to make clear to the pupils the problem involved
in the work to be accomplished during the study hour. The
best time to make assignments is when, as the subject is developed,
a problem arises which cannot then be solved. A
good recitation ought to culminate in the statement of the
questions yet to be answered quite as much as in a statement
of what has been accomplished. If the class has been kept
intellectually alert, there ought to be raised by the children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
many questions, which may be assigned either to the whole class
or to individuals for report at a succeeding recitation.</p>

<p>A very good incentive to study is found in making assignments
to individuals or groups for report to the whole class.
Even if the problem itself is not of surpassing interest, the
desire to contribute one’s share to the group project, and the
wish to do as well as one’s neighbor, will stimulate to greater
effort. It would be well if teachers tested their own work
and the children’s comprehension of the assignments made
by asking frequently during the study period for a statement
of the problem. To read a book intelligently, to perform an
experiment to advantage, children must know what they
seek. The attitude which we hope to develop should lead
a child to ask, when in doubt, such questions as these: “What
am I to try to find out from reading this chapter?” “What
am I to look for on the excursion?” “What is the problem
which we are now discussing?” “Is the report which has
just been made to the point?” “Did John’s answer have
anything to do with the question we are discussing?” and
the like. When children have learned to expect to work
toward the accomplishment of some definite result in thought
as well as in action, when they hold to the main issue regardless
of the allurements of subsidiary problems which should
be held for later investigation, when they become critical of the
contributions offered by books or by their companions, then,
and not until then, have they taken the first step in learning
to study.</p>

<p>When children have become conscious of the meaning of the
aim or problem as an element in successful study, and when
their practice is guided by this consciousness, they will meet
with another difficulty in learning how to secure the data
adequate for the solution of the problem. Before leaving the
elementary school, children should know how to use dictionaries,
encyclopedias, gazetteers, year books, and the like. It is
passing strange that college students often seem not to know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the purpose either of the table of contents or of the index in
the books which they use. It is pitiful to see a person leafing
through a book trying to find information on some question
at issue, when in a minute he could find in the index just the
page or section in which this topic is treated, and so spend the
time gathering data instead of wasting it in a random search
for the information desired. It is necessary to teach children
to consult the indices and tables of contents of books, and to
give them frequent practice in work of this kind, if they are
commonly to employ this device or method.</p>

<p>Another help to the collection of data might very well begin
to be used in the intermediate grades of the elementary school;
it is the practice of noting, when more than one book or source
of information is used, just where the information is to be
found, and something of its nature. If the pupil consults more
than one authority, the one read last may raise questions
which must be answered by a return to those used earlier, and
one ought to be able to turn directly to the sources formerly
consulted. Or it may be that a similar problem, or one having
much in common with it, will arise a week or a month later,
when a record of the sources of information consulted before
will lighten the work by half. A record of this sort could be
kept in notebooks, or, as is done by older people who know
how to work, in a card index. Of course work of this kind
presupposes the use of some books other than a single textbook;
and to go very far in giving children the command of
the technique of study we shall have to provide ourselves
with more than a single book for a subject.</p>

<p>Another way by which children can be greatly helped is
teaching them how to take notes and how to annotate. There
is no exercise more valuable to the student, so far as his future
work is concerned, than practice in writing in a very few words
the gist of a paragraph or page. As they reflect later, they
may want to know the argument of this authority or that,
but they must have it in condensed form or they will be little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
better off than when they began their work. A very helpful
exercise is to have children to abstract, either orally or in writing,
a page or two of a book which they are studying, and to
compare results. In this work the problem is that which confronts
the thinker at every stage of his work, the selection of
that which is relevant and the discarding of that which is less
significant. If we think logically, among the mass of possible
data we must always choose that which in our judgment is
relatively most valuable for our purpose. The teacher in the
organization of material for presentation in any subject is confronted
constantly with the problem of relative values. Not
all can be presented, even though relevant to the issue involved;
hence, choice must be made. And just so, if the child
learns to study, to conduct his own investigations, he must
be made conscious of this need of discrimination, and he must
be given practice in its exercise.</p>

<p>Adequate study demands not simply that an abundance
of data which bear on the problem be secured, but that the
validity of the data be brought into question. Children ought
not to accept blindly the statements of books or even of the
teacher. The one thing which characterizes the student is his
search for truth, his attitude of inquiry as opposed to an appeal
to authority. It is well for children at times to question the
statements found in their books when experience suggests
the doubt. It is equally important, of course, that they be
willing to acknowledge their mistake, should proof be forthcoming
in support of the book. If a child really studies, he
must, even as an adult, find statements of fact, the records
of observations or experiments, which are at variance with the
evidence which he already possesses. It is just in this particular
that the student differs from ordinary men who allow
others to do their thinking for them. The student may not
be able to settle the question, and so forms a judgment which
is frankly tentative. Children ought to have the experience
of finding that there are some questions to which a definite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
answer cannot, in the present state of knowledge, be given.
They should be shown, wherever possible, how the conclusions
of men on some of the most important problems that
have been studied have changed from time to time. They
can at times be made to realize the folly of overhasty generalization.</p>

<p>No one has learned how to study who has not been trained
to reflect upon his experience, whether the experience has been
recently acquired with the express purpose of solving his problem,
or is some more remote element in experience which may
shed light on the question in hand. A skillful teacher can
guide in this process of reflection, and will later tell them what
is meant, and demonstrate for them something of the value
of the practice. It is quite worth while for a student to know
when he has concentrated his attention upon a problem, and
just what is meant by reflection. Many older people deceive
themselves into thinking that they are exercising themselves
in these directions when a slight acquaintance with the elements
involved in fixing attention or in reflection might awaken
them to the futility of their practices. There need be nothing
occult or hard to understand about the practice of study.
It is not a matter of terminology nor of a systematic course
in psychology, but rather consists in guiding the individual
in his practice of the art, and then making known to him the
elements in his experience which have meant success or failure.
It may be enlightening to compare the emphasis upon careful
examination of data, the formation of tentative rather than
fixed judgments, the guarding against hasty generalizations,
and the emphasis upon reflection with the steps of presentation,
of comparison and abstraction, and of generalization in the
inductive lesson, and with the corresponding steps of the deductive
lesson. The conviction will probably be deepened
that when the teacher instructs the student in the art of study
she is making available for him the method which she employs
in instruction. This must be the relationship; for the teacher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
can do nothing more than take account of the way the child
learns, and adapt her method to his possibilities.</p>

<p>The habit of verification is one of the most important from
the point of view of learning how to study. The questions
which the student must constantly ask himself are: “Can the
conclusions be applied?” “Do they always hold?” “Does
it work?” Fine-spun theories are of little avail, however
much satisfaction the originator of them may have found in
deriving them. At every step in the progress of his thought
the conclusions must be tested by an appeal to known facts.
The teacher cannot too frequently insist upon this step as the
criterion of the worth of the thinking which has been done.
And the insistence will be necessary, for it seems natural for
human beings to become so enamored of their theories that
they hesitate to expose them to the test which may prove them
false.</p>

<p><em>Teaching children to memorize</em>: Throughout the school life
of the child, memorizing is a regular part of his work. If
practice alone were necessary, every child should soon learn
how to do this kind of work in the most economical manner.
The great difficulty is that often neither teacher nor pupil has
given any thought to the method employed, their attention having
been wholly engrossed with success or failure in achieving
the result. It is a well established principle of psychology
that the possibility of recall is conditioned by the system
of ideas with which that which we wish to recall has been identified.
The more associations made, or the more perfect our
control of any system of ideas which involves that which we
wish to remember, the greater the probability of bringing to
mind the fact when we need it. As Professor James puts it:
“Of two men with the same outward experience, <em>the one who
thinks over his experiences most</em>, and weaves them into the most
systematic relations with each other, will be the one with the
best memory.” And along with this fact is another equally
important for the teacher: that we may not hope to increase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the native power of retentiveness. The child whom we teach
may be endowed by nature with little or much power of this
sort, and we cannot change it; but we can improve his method
of memorizing.</p>

<p>The first step in memorizing is to understand. If we try
to commit to memory the words of a book when we do not fully
comprehend the meaning, we are depending very largely on
our desultory memory, <em>i.e.</em> upon our ability to remember the
things because they have been once present in mind; and our
efficiency will depend wholly upon our quality of native retentiveness.
But, unfortunately, for want of knowledge of
a better method, children are frequently satisfied that they are
doing adequate work when they are repeating over and over
again the words which they have made little attempt to comprehend.</p>

<p>Even when the sense of the words to be memorized is fairly
clear, it is uneconomical to employ this method of accretion.
The child who studies the poem by saying first the first line, then
the second, then the first and second, then the third, then the
first, the second, and the third, depends upon mere repetition,
not upon thinking, for the persistence of the impression. It
has been demonstrated that on the basis of the amount of
time required this method is uneconomical. Add to this the
fact that after the first complete repetition, later successful
recall depends upon the efficiency of the system of associated
ideas which have been established; and there can be no doubt
of the folly of such a method of procedure. It is no wonder
that children who commit to memory in this way forget so
readily. They may have understood what they said when
they first repeated the poem; but the method they employed
almost precludes the building up of a system of associated
ideas on the basis of careful thinking.</p>

<p>If the child has read aloud and understands the selection to
be memorized, the next thing to be done is to analyze it into its
principal thought units; and then each of these large units<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
of thought may be again carefully scrutinized until a full appreciation
of the thought has been accomplished. The thought
of the whole may then be stated, using as far as possible the
words of the author, and then each of the subdivisions or
thought units may be examined in more detail in order to get
the shade of meaning that is brought out by this or that word,
by relationship of coördination or subordination of clause, or
the modification indicated by this word or phrase. It will be
necessary, as the work progresses on the large thought units
into which the selection has been divided, to return constantly
to the whole thought in order to keep clear the relationship of
the part to the whole, and to establish the part in the system of
ideas which we seek to build up. “All the evidence we have
goes to show that the method of memorizing by wholes is most
economical.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> If children were taught to work in this way,
there would be little drudgery about memorizing. The careful,
thoughtful study once completed, memorization has been
accomplished. The energy and attention of the child have not
been centered upon a merely technical process, but he has been
concerned mainly in trying to appreciate fully the thought that
he is to make his own. Memory work of this kind is highly
educative, not merely because of the product, but also because
of the process employed. Suppose, for example, you wish
children to memorize Stevenson’s <cite>Bed in Summer</cite>:—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">In winter I get up at night</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Or hear the grown-up people’s feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still going past me in the street.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And does it not seem hard to you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When all the sky is clear and blue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I should like so much to play,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To have to go to bed by day?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">You would begin by reading the whole poem, calling to mind
the experiences of the children in going to bed before dark on
the long summer evenings and of the cold, dark winter mornings
when they may have dressed before it was light. The
number and the kind of explanations which will need to be
made will, of course, depend upon the previous experience of
the children and the time of the year. Then the poem might
be read again a time or two. After this preliminary work has
been done, you might ask some one to tell you the story. Let
us suppose that the reply was about as follows: “A little boy
had to get up before it was light in the winter, and go to bed
before it was dark in the summer. In summer when he went
to bed he heard the birds hopping on the trees and the people
walking past him in the street. He thought it was hard to
have to go to bed when it was still daylight, when he wanted
so much to play.” If the main facts were less well told, or if
there were notable omissions, it would be necessary to get at
least an outline of the main thought before proceeding. Now
we are ready to call the attention of the children to three main
thoughts, each told in a stanza. First, the difference between
getting up in winter and going to bed in summer. Second,
what did the boy in the story see and hear when he went to bed
before dark? Third, how do you feel when you have to go to
bed in summer while the sky is still so clear and blue, and you
would like so much to play?</p>

<p>It will be very easy to get the thought of the first stanza
impressed in the words of the author. It will help to read
the whole poem again, the teacher meanwhile asking the children
to pay particular attention to the way the author says
it. Possibly there will be some difficulty with “quite the
other way,” but skillful questioning will get the correct form.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
And so for the second and third stanzas; if the thought is clear,
the words will follow very easily. After each thought has been
thus carefully developed, with the whole story always in mind,
and the words of the author have been made the vehicle of expressing
the thought by the children, it will be advantageous
to have the poem repeated several times by individual members
of the class. In this repetition the dramatic element
should enter as far as possible. To suit the action to the word,
to really feel what one recites, helps greatly to strengthen the
impression, and thus aids recall.</p>

<p>It may be thought that the illustration used was particularly
well adapted to illustrate the theory advanced. Or some
teacher may say that children would memorize <cite>Bed in Summer</cite>
without teaching. It may, therefore, not be out of place to
suggest that the best way to discover for one’s self the value
of the method is to try it. It will work equally well if the subject
is Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, a selection from the
Declaration of Independence, the Twenty-third Psalm, or any
other masterpiece of English.</p>

<p>The principles to be applied are essentially the same even
when verbatim memorization is not required. To get lasting
control of the facts of geography or of history, one must have
reduced them to a system. There must be a relating of less
important facts to more important, a clustering of important
points of reference to any other facts which are logically related.
This, indeed, is just what scientific organization means,
and the main purpose of such organization is to render facts more
available, to save labor. The memory is relieved of much of
its burden when once we have established the relationship of
cause and effect, of equivalence, of similarity, or of analogy
among facts. It is this association of ideas on a logical basis
which counts most in the possibility of recall.</p>

<p>It is quite possible for children, very early in their school life,
to begin to apply these principles and to become conscious of
the fact that the way they do their work has an important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
bearing upon the ease with which it is accomplished and the
permanency of the results gained. The work of the teacher
is not done by merely dictating the method, even though that
may help greatly to establish right habits of study; our best
assurance that the method will be employed when the teacher
is not present to direct the work is found in our knowledge that
the children not only habitually, but also when a question
arises or there is a suggestion of another way, consciously
employ the right method.</p>

<p><em>Teaching children how to form habits</em>: Our next problem
is to inquire how children may be led consciously to employ
the principles of habit formation when their school work involves
work of this type. They can be taught the function of
drill or repetition, and can be led to see under what conditions
such work will prove most successful. It is not difficult to
prove to a boy that his listless, half-hearted work in repeating
the spelling of the words he has missed is making little improvement
in his ability to spell them. A boy can be led to
see by an illustration in which he himself is the chief actor
that concentrated attention will make much difference. Let
him see how much he can accomplish in ten minutes, and thus
get him in the habit of using this means when he finds that he
is not working up to his normal capacity. Show him that a
new impetus will be given and that attention will be easier if
he reverses the order, writes instead of spelling orally, or closes
his eyes and attempts to visualize the words. No matter
what motive the boy has for the attempt he is making, he will
welcome the suggestions which make the task easier.</p>

<p>Later you can teach this same boy the need of verification
before drilling himself whenever a question of fact is raised. In
the beginning, of course, the doubt or question will be raised by
the teacher, and it will be the chief work of the child to find an
authority and assure himself that he has the right idea or form
before proceeding. A big step in the education of a child has
been taken when he is able to say, “I know I am right, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
I have consulted the commonly accepted authority.” Occasions
will arise constantly in the study of any subject where,
instead of asking the teacher or being satisfied with information
which is of questionable validity, the child should, as a matter
of habit, turn to the authority for verification. It is not at
all unusual for children to have misgivings, but they too frequently
end by going ahead and ignoring their doubt. To
respect one’s doubts, to be somewhat critical, is significant for
education only when one is led thereby to endeavor to discover
the truth. Children will work to advantage when they realize
that these steps of doubt, verification, repetition, with undivided
attention, are essential to good work.</p>

<p>Children can be taught the necessity of accuracy in practice.
Any day’s work in a schoolroom will furnish illustrations of
the danger of lapses and the necessity of guarding against them.
The fallacy of the notion that “this one doesn’t count” can be
made just as clear to children as to adults. So, too, the mistaken
notion that cramming may be substituted for systematic
work day in and day out can be brought to the attention of
pupils.</p>

<p>It would be a good plan for every teacher to ask herself
questions like the following: “What would the children do if I
did not carefully direct their work?” “How much better able
are they now to work independently than they were at the
beginning of the year?” “Can they take a book and find in it
the part which bears upon the topic assigned for study, and
do they do it with the least possible waste of time and energy?”
“Do they know how to memorize; what it means to concentrate
their attention; how to reflect?” “Are they more
open-minded or more dogmatic on account of the year spent
with me?” “Have they established the habit of verification?”
“Do they appreciate the method to be employed in
habit formation?” To answer these questions honestly will
give the teacher some idea of her success as a teacher, for the
teacher’s goal is realized in proportion as her pupils have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
advanced in power to work independently of her guidance or
control.</p>

<p>In teaching children how to study, it will be well to devote
whole periods to this type of exercise. The teacher will gain
much in the progress which her class will make by taking a
period frequently during which she studies with the children.

<p>3. What exercises would you give your pupils to make them able to

<p>4. State five problems which you have assigned to your pupils which
seem to you to have furnished a sufficient motive for study.</p>

<p>5. Which would be better as an assignment for a class in history:
“Study the topic of slavery for to-morrow”; or, “Try to find out why
slaves were not kept in the Northern states”; or, “Did all of the people
in the Northern states believe that slavery should be abolished?”</p>

<p>6. What is the advantage in individual or group assignments? Give
a list of such assignments which you have recently given to your class.</p>

<p>7. Why is it necessary in studying to restate the problem under consideration
at frequent intervals?</p>

<p>8. When children study, should they try to remember all that they
read in their books?</p>

<p>9. Is it wise to have children critical of each other’s contributions

<p>13. Take any poem of from four to ten stanzas, and have your pupils
commit it to memory as a whole by reading it over and discussing the

length and of equal difficulty, according to your judgment, and have
them commit it to memory line by line and stanza by stanza. (A good

<span class="fs80">REVIEW OR EXAMINATION LESSON</span></h2>


<p>The review or the examination, in so far as methods of
teaching are concerned, present the same problem. We seek
by means of exercises of this type to bring about a better organization
of knowledge, to test the efficiency of our work by
finding out whether or not pupils can, when put to the test,
utilize the knowledge or habits which we have labored to make
available for them, whether they are actuated by the ideals
and purposes which we have sought to inculcate, whether they
do actually employ the most economical methods of work
when they meet a situation which challenges their strength.
It will be recognized at once that work of this sort is a part of
every recitation. But for our own satisfaction, and, possibly,
in order to meet the requirements which may be imposed by
those higher in authority, we may at times feel the need for a
stated exercise of this sort.</p>

<p>A review should mean a new view, a placing of facts in their
true relationship. It should mean a clearer view of the topic
or the subject which the children have been studying. It
avails little to go over the ground that has already been covered
more rapidly. The purpose to be accomplished is not to fix
in mind a series of unrelated facts. In our discussion of memory
we had occasion to call attention to the fact that recall of
past experiences was conditioned by the number and the
quality of the associations which had been established. And
it is not simply a matter of recall. The use that we can make
of a fact depends upon our ability to relate it logically to other
facts. It is quite possible that a man of great native retentiveness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
might be able to recall thousands of facts, and yet be
stupid, utterly unable to do the thinking required for effective
action. To bring about such an organization of ideas demands
that from day to day the new facts or principles that are learned
be consciously related to the old. It will not be economical
to put off all reviewing until the end of the month, or quarter,
or term. The step taken in advance to-day can be properly
appreciated only when it is seen in relation to that which has
gone before; and the work of the past week or month will, in
turn, by this additional effort be seen in truer perspective.</p>

<p>There are, however, convenient units into which subjects
naturally divide themselves; and when one of these units has
been completed, it may be well to take a period or two for
the express purpose of review. We may then clear up any
misconceptions, give a chance for additional verification and
application of the knowledge thus far gained. It cannot be
too strongly emphasized that the review which really counts
is one in which the teacher works with the children, guides
them and instructs them, rather than sits in judgment over
them. There is nothing more disastrous to the best type of
work than the idea on the part of children that the review lesson
is the teacher’s opportunity to ask catch questions, or to
overemphasize unimportant details. Children respond very
quickly in such a situation by their endeavor to cram, with
little or no effort at organization, all of the facts that they
have been taught.</p>

<p>A convenient stimulus to the proper sort of review is found
in the requirement that pupils prepare an abstract or topical
outline of the ground which has been covered, and submit it,
preferably from memory, for class criticism and discussion. If
the teacher asks questions, she should be very careful to see
that they are questions of large scope which demand organization,
or still better the application of organized knowledge.
This brings us to the problem of testing.</p>

<p>The only adequate test of school education, as of all other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
education, is action. The nearer we can in our tests reproduce
the conditions which will confront the child in actual life, the
better. Not that we can always have him actually present
in the situation; but when that is impossible, we can present
for his consideration ideal situations which correspond to those
which he will later find. The possibilities of presenting precisely
the test which he will meet and is meeting in life are, I
believe, much greater than most examiners suspect. We
have discovered after many years that the best test of a child’s
ability to spell in the only situation in which he will ever need
to spell is to test him in that situation; <em>i.e.</em> by judging his ability
in writing words in connected discourse. The way to discover
whether one can speak or write grammatically is to listen to him
speaking or reading what he has written, and not to ask him to
recite rules of grammar. The only real test of a child’s ability
to give adequate oral expression to the story or poem is to see
whether or not he can make clear the thought and furnish
enjoyment to others, preferably to those who have not before
heard the selection which he reads. We can assure ourselves
that we have awakened an interest in literature and history,
when we know that children read good books other than those
which we compel them to read. The success of manual work,
the time spent in art or music, ought certainly to be measured
by ability to make and to decorate, the singing of songs, and
the desire to hear music, or to see pictures. The more occasions
that can be found for the application of the arithmetic we
teach in actual measurements and computations which have
real significance to children, the better will children understand
their work, and the more certain we can be of their future
efficiency.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It is coming to be a recognized principle of
nature study that the common things, the animals and plants
which are significant for our living, are the ones which should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
engage our attention; and we expect that children will, on
account of the teaching, enjoy more, take better care of, and
utilize to better advantage the plant and animal life with which
they come in contact. Even in such subjects as history and
geography, one can hope to find just such applications while
the child is studying as are apt to occur in his later life. The
presentation of the results of the study of a country to a school
assembly with the aid of pictures and a lantern, or the interpretation
of current events in the light of their geographic
setting will afford no mean test of the children’s knowledge of
geography. The comparison of to-day’s happenings in the
light of the events of a decade or a century ago; the explanation
of the historical reference in the period devoted to literature;
the writing and presentation of a historical drama, will
afford as great application of one’s knowledge as most of us
ever make.</p>

<p>Work of the sort indicated above will not only serve to test
the value of the work that children have done, but will also
add greatly to the interest and enthusiasm with which children
do their work. We can scarcely hope that all examinations
will satisfy this ideal; but of this we can be sure, the more
work of this kind we do with our pupils, the firmer will be their
grasp upon their work and the greater is apt to be their power
to satisfy even less adequate tests.</p>

<p>Examinations have another function which we as teachers
should not overlook. Any adequate test of children’s abilities
is also a test of our teaching. It will probably not be best for
us to try to defend ourselves by pleading the inadequacy of
the test, nor the backwardness of the pupils when they come
to us, nor their parentage, nor any other less common reason.
If children do not write as well as they should, if they misspell
words they commonly use in their written work, if they cannot
tell the story, recite the poem, solve the problem, describe
the geographical area, or relate the events of the historic
period, we had better inquire whether we have helped them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
to work to best advantage, whether we have clearly differentiated
the several aspects of our work and have then
applied the methods suitable to accomplish the desired result.
There may be mistakes made, but, all things else being equal,
the teacher who gets results is the best teacher.</p>

<p>We shall do better work, children, teachers, and supervisors,
when we have provided for our use more definite standards
or scales by which to measure our results. There is no reason
why we should not have a scale which would enable us to tell
with a fair degree of accuracy just what the standing of this
group of children is in writing, in ability to perform the fundamental
operations in arithmetic, in spelling, in writing compositions,
in discussing the geography of North America, in
decorating a cover for a notebook, or in any other subject or
aspect of their school work. Beginnings have been made in
this direction, and we may hope for more as time passes.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
As these units of measure are perfected and applied in examining
the results of school work, we will, of course, hear the cry
of those who will tell us that the best things that a teacher
does cannot be measured. The obvious reply will be that
efficiency in accomplishing results which can be measured need
not in any way prevent a teacher from exercising that influence
or doing that sort of work which is not recorded on examination
sheets. Rather it will be found, I venture, that the efficient
teachers, as measured by the results which we can test, are,
on the whole, the teachers that are doing the noblest work.
Strength of personality, appreciation of child nature, a life
which by its example makes for truth and beauty in other lives,
are qualities not uncommon in the teacher who is glad to be
judged by the results which pupils can demonstrate.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE RECITATION LESSON</span></h2>


<p>The recitation lesson as commonly conducted consists in
having children tell what they have read in their textbooks.
Sometimes the teacher accepts or even demands that the pupils
recite by repeating the words of the book. Better teaching
requires rather that they render the thought of the author in
their own language. In this chapter we shall discuss some of
the worthy ends which may be accomplished by such an exercise,
some of the common deficiencies in work of this type,
and the modifications which are advisable in the light of the
principles already enunciated.</p>

<p>The recitation lesson commonly tests the pupil’s memory
for facts. The questions asked and answered serve to reveal
to the teacher the knowledge or lack of it on the part of the
pupil. In a way this testing also gives the teacher some idea
of the amount of work done by the pupil. The great weakness
of work of this kind is found in the tendency to demand and
to accept words, the rehearsing of facts unrelated and unorganized.
Of course this need not be true, since it is entirely
within the power of the teacher to frame her questions in
such a way that the pupil’s grasp on the whole topic rather
than his memory for isolated facts is tested.</p>

<p>The recitation which tests the pupil’s ability to present in
orderly fashion the substance of the thought found in the
sections assigned in the book for study is of genuine value.
The topical recitation affords an opportunity to develop on
the part of children the ability to stand on their feet and speak
to a question for some minutes. And it may be suggested in
this connection that we should develop more power of this sort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
than is commonly found in our schools. The ability to express
one’s self adequately on the topic under consideration will
always make for effectiveness in social life. It would be well
to test the progress of our pupils from grade to grade by their
ability to speak more effectively and for a longer period as
they advance through the school, on some topic connected
with their school work.</p>

<p>When pupils are required not simply to recite on some topic
which is presented for their consideration, but are required
to furnish their own outline and to recite on the basis of their
own organization of the selections which they have read, the
recitation may become a valuable exercise in thinking. The
success of work of this kind will depend upon the definiteness
with which the problem or aim of the work has been provided.
It will not require much thought simply to follow the paragraph
headings or marginal notes of the author and to present the
organization as a basis for recitation. If, however, a problem
has been suggested the solution of which may be found in
the pages assigned for study, then the recitation may test the
pupil’s power to analyze and organize the material which the
book provides. And this is the only test of a thorough
mastery of the book. We do not read to find out everything
that an author says. Our needs may demand a very different
ordering of facts, we may use facts in entirely new relations, and
may ignore much that was essential from a different point of
view. Children have read their textbooks thoroughly when
they have derived from these texts the facts or ideas which are
essential in the solution of their problem, the satisfaction of the
aim which they hope to realize.</p>

<p>This ability to use to best advantage a book is a very valuable
accomplishment. When the recitation lesson accomplishes
this result, it justifies its use. Too frequently we find
adults who seem to feel that they must try to gather all of the
knowledge and must try to follow none other than the author’s
point of view in their reading. These persons read one book,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
and, as a result, believe one theory. It seems not to disturb
them greatly that the next book they read takes the opposite
point of view and that they range themselves on that side of
the question. Books are, or at least ought to be, our servants,
not our masters, and in the handling of books in his regular
school work the child ought to come to realize their true
function. There is no greater proof of a lack of thought than
the ready acceptance of whatever one finds in print.</p>

<p>There is great danger in the use of textbooks that children
and teachers will become satisfied with words, that they will
come to think that the repetition of the formula of the textbook
is proof of knowledge. Textbooks are all too often
merely books of texts. They have been made frequently
enough by those who possess a very wide knowledge of the field
in which they write; and by some strange process of thought
they have apparently reached the conclusion that the way to
make a subject simple is to condense it. Many of our most
used textbooks are merely summaries or outlines of the subject
treated. They lack richness of detail, and state conclusions
instead of furnishing a large number of experiences, from which
one may, through processes of logical thought, derive the generalizations
of the subject. Take, for example, most of the textbooks
in history for elementary schools, and read carefully
upon any topic selected at random, and then ask yourself just
what these <em>words</em> mean to twelve-year-old children; or, better
still, ask these children who repeat so glibly the words or reproduce
the statements of the book just what they mean by
the words they use. Try to discover whether they have any
adequate knowledge of facts, or any command of images,
which would make possible the generalizations which they give
as a result of the process of thought. Remember that a textbook
is not logical for children because it has been logically
arranged by the scholar. The test is rather to be found in the
pupil’s ability to reproduce in his own thinking the steps which
have made possible the conclusions of the author.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>Any wide-awake teacher can make her work more interesting
and more significant for children, if she will carefully provide
for the enrichment of the text. The sources from which data
can be gathered, regardless of the subject under consideration,
are almost without number. Especially to be recommended
are the standard works in the subjects. It will be interesting
to discover that children would rather read Parkman than to
study the text in which some less competent person has endeavored
to tell his story in a few paragraphs which mean
absolutely nothing to the child. The magazines which publish
articles of wide social interest will furnish much helpful
material. There is no school that may not greatly enrich its
work by an appeal to the actual experiences of the children
and by carefully directed observations and experiments. We
need our textbooks as a summary, as a convenient condensed
outline, or as books of reference; but we must provide as
best we can other books of reference which will furnish the
details which are impossible in the limited number of pages
allowed to the text. In every room of every school a
library of books, pamphlets, magazine articles, and illustrative
material should be found, and every teacher should expect
to increase this collection and to improve its quality as the
years go by.</p>

<p>It will give new meaning to notebooks and note-taking, if
both teacher and children realize that the books thus prepared
are a real addition to the texts used. A comparison of the
work done by different members of the class will add interest
in the work. One of the greatest deficiencies of the recitation
lesson is the danger that nothing new will be presented. It is
not intellectually stimulating to listen to others who repeat
simply the thought with which you are already familiar.
Where good notebook work is done and reported upon, the
chance for new ideas, the stimulus to thought, through the
presentation of new material, will greatly strengthen the work.</p>

<p>A tendency in work of this type to accept vague and indefinite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
answers is another argument against the recitation
lesson which consists merely in rehearsing the words of the
book. Statements are apt to be vague when ideas are vague,
and we may not expect ideas to be very clear when the child
lacks experience. The child’s power of expression, aside
from the difference in original talent in this direction, is conditioned
first of all by his acquaintance with things and processes.
The recitation lesson, as it is ordinarily conducted,
gives little opportunity for this sort of firsthand knowledge.
To work at the sand table, to construct with wood, clay, paper,
or yarn, to experiment, and to observe carefully the working
of nature may mean more for the command of language than
much more time devoted to so-called language lessons. But
the effective use of such experience for language growth depends
in a measure upon the requirement that the teacher
makes for adequate expression. The teacher who accepts the
vague and indefinite answer encourages slovenly habits of
expression and incidentally slovenly habits of thought. It is
usually a mistake to say to a child: “I know what you mean
even though you have not said it.” Children are often lazy
enough to allow the teacher to do their thinking for them, if
the teacher willingly accepts the burden. Thinking is necessary
for expression; language is the tool of thought; we can
do no greater service to children than to hold them for what
they say, give them credit for the thought which they express
and no more. Words for children, as well as for adults, are
used to conceal ignorance as well as to reveal thought. A child
is quick to take advantage of the teacher who will accept any
sort of an answer and interpret it as a statement containing
thought. Indeed, it is possible that a child may even come to
think that his incoherent statements, his word juggling, really
represent thought.</p>

<p>Another danger in the recitation lesson is found in the
tendency to develop the purely individualistic attitude. If
excellence consists in endeavoring to repeat more of the book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
statement than any one else, manifestly it is your advantage
to hinder rather than to help others in their work. The
attitude of excessive competition on the one hand, and of indifference
on the other, are both avoided when children work
together for common ends. The standard of the school should
be coöperation and helpfulness.</p>

<p>The recitation lesson in its least desirable aspects will not
disappear until all of our teachers realize that teaching does
not consist in hearing lessons. The broader the training of
the teacher, the better her understanding of child nature and
of the meaning of education, the less likely is she to resort to
this method to any considerable degree. We shall, it is true,
so long as we use textbooks, take occasion to discover what use
children have made of them; but this testing will be incidental
to our teaching, and not the sum and substance of it.</p>

<p>“<em>The Puritans.</em>—The New England colonies were founded by English
Puritans who left England because they could not do as they wished in the
home land. All Puritans were agreed in wishing for a freer government than
they had had in England under the Stuart kings, and in state matters were
really the liberals of their time. In religious matters, however, they were not
all of one mind. Some of them wished to make only a few changes in the
church. These were called Non-Conformists. Others wished to make so many
changes in religion that they could not stay in the English State Church. These
were called Separatists. The settlers of Plymouth were Separatists; the
settlers of Boston and neighboring towns were Non-Conformists.”</p>

<p>“Unlike the poor humble Pilgrims were the founders of Massachusetts.
They were men of wealth and social position, as, for instance, John Winthrop
and Sir Richard Saltonstall. They left comfortable homes in England to
found a Puritan state in America. They got a tract of land extending from
the Merrimac to the Charles, and westward across the continent. Hundreds
of colonists came over in the year 1629-1630. They settled Boston, Salem,
and neighboring towns. In the next ten years thousands more joined them.

Professor Johnson</ins> asks, “Do the children see or feel anything but
words? Do they see Puritans? Do they see anything that the Puritans
might change or any reason for changing it? Do they see anything
that happened in America?... But what do the words
actually tell about the circumstances of the Puritans?... Can any
one think that such statements really convey information about the
Puritans to one who is being introduced to them for the first time?”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<span class="fs80">QUESTIONING</span></h2>


<p>In all teaching much depends upon the skill with which the
teacher stimulates and guides the class by means of the questions
which she asks. Occasionally one finds a teacher who
seems to think that the sole purpose of questioning is to test
the knowledge of her pupils. She asks hundreds of questions
which can be answered merely by an appeal to the memory.
This sort of testing is valuable for review, but it does not necessitate
thought. When a teacher habitually asks these fact
questions, the children respond by trying to remember the
words or the facts given in their books.</p>

<p>A type of question still less worthy is the direct question,—the
one that can be answered by yes or no. The teacher who
asks, “Is Albany on the Hudson River?” does not expect the
children to think. If they are fairly bright, they will probably
guess from her inflection whether the answer is yes or no.
In any event, after one guess has been made there is only one
alternative, and the pupil who answers second often deceives
both the teacher and himself into thinking that he really knew
the answer. The question which suggests an alternative is
in effect the same as a direct question with its alternative
answer of yes and no. “Does the earth turn on its axis from
east to west or from west to east?” is no better than to ask,
“Does the earth turn on its axis from west to east?” Indeed,
the alternative question in the example given is worse than
the direct form, since it suggests a wrong answer which may
make sufficient impression to confuse the pupils when the
question arises again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>The leading or suggestive question is much used by teachers
who attempt to develop with children generalizations for which
they have no basis in knowledge. It is perfectly possible to
have children give some sort of expression to the most profound
generalizations of science or philosophy, if one is only skillful
in suggesting the answers which they are to give. As an example
of this sort of questioning, the following is taken almost
verbatim from a teacher who thought she was having her children
think about the growth of plants. “Did you plant your
flowers where the sun would shine on them? Do you think
plants would grow in a very dark place? What do plants
need to help them to grow? When the ground gets dry, what
will you sprinkle on the ground to help the plants to grow?
What do plants need besides light to make them grow?
Would your plants grow if it was very cold? What do plants
need besides light and moisture to make them grow?” If
such a series of suggestive questions is asked, the responses
will be prompt and the waving of hands most vigorous, but
surely there has been very little necessity for thinking on the
part of the children. This brings us to the crux of the whole
problem. A question in order to be most stimulating must be
of sufficient scope to demand that the experience of the children
be organized anew with reference to the problem under
consideration.</p>

<p>The teacher who wants to test the quality of her questions
ought frequently to ask herself whether her questions are of
sufficient scope. If all the children can answer every question
asked immediately, the questions have not been very successful
from the standpoint of provoking thought. It takes time
to think. The question of large scope will be followed, not
by a wild waving of hands, but rather by a period of quiet
reflection. The teacher who was trying to have her pupils
think about the conditions of plant growth should have asked
one or two thought-provoking questions instead of the larger
number of suggestive questions. She might have put the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
questions: What have you known any one to do to get
good, strong, healthy plants? Would it be possible to change
any of these conditions and still have the best plants? What
is necessary for the growth of plants? If questions similar to
the above are asked, one might naturally expect children to
relate and to compare experiences, in fact, to solve the problem
by bringing to bear as best they could the facts concerning
plant growth which had been observed in their experience. If
the teacher wants the children to get some adequate idea of a
mountain, in their work in home geography she might tell
them about it or read them a description; but even after the
best description she would want to question them in order to
have them think about the facts which had been given. She
might ask: How long do you think it would take a man to
walk to the top of a mountain? What would be the difficulties
in getting to the top? If you stood on the top and threw a
stone, how far down the mountain do you think it would go?</p>

<p>To ask good questions takes careful thought and planning
on the part of the teacher. A half dozen thoroughly good
questions often make a recitation a most stimulating exercise
in thinking, while the absence of this preparation on the part
of the teacher not infrequently results in the ordinary listless
class period, which may actually be harmful from the standpoint
of the child’s intellectual growth. It would be well for
every teacher to ask herself the following questions when she
is dissatisfied with the results of her teaching: Were my
questions clear and concise? Did they challenge the attention
of all the members of the class? Did the children need to
think, to organize their experience with reference to the problem
in hand before they answered? Was the sequence good?
Was it possible for every child to answer some of the questions?
Did each child have a chance to answer? Did the children
ask questions?—When children are active mentally, they will
have questions to ask.</p>

<p>In asking questions much depends upon the novelty of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
form in which the question is put or of the issue which is
presented. The writer has enjoyed asking several groups of
teachers why they teach. The answers have been most varied,
and on the whole indicate the real attitude of these men and
women toward their work. A very different response is secured,
however, when you ask the same groups to define the
aim of education. They will all profess that they hope to
realize the aim of education in their teaching, and that it is
because they hope to participate in the development of socially
efficient men and women that they teach; always provided
you have asked a question concerning the aim of education.
The difference in the two situations is accounted for by the
difference in the wording of the question. In the one case
these teachers really asked themselves the question—why do I
teach? They answered in terms of their experience. Some
taught for money, some because it was a respectable calling,
some for want of anything better to do, some because they liked
children, and some because of their appreciation of the significance
of education in our modern democratic society. In the
other case, the answers were given in words conveying ideas
which were supposed to be those most acceptable to the teacher.</p>

<p>It is often helpful to state the opposite of the common expression
of a generalization and to suggest that you are willing
to maintain this point of view. The best lesson that the writer
ever conducted on induction and deduction was begun with
the statement: “Induction always begins with a generalization
and moves to the consideration of particulars. Deduction
always begins with a particular and moves to a generalization.”
The class was excited because the usual form of expression had
been reversed, and, before the period was over, did some thinking
about the commonly accepted definitions of induction and
deduction. These definitions had really been nothing but a lot
of words to juggle with, rather than the embodiment of clear
ideas. This method of shock through the unfamiliar form of
the question, or by means of a statement which challenges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
attention because it is seemingly contrary to the accepted formula,
is one of the surest means available to the teacher who
would stimulate thought.</p>

<p>It may be objected by some teacher that the form of question
indicated above gives little or no place to the necessary
reciting from books; that when one wants to discover whether
the pupils have studied carefully the content of a text, the
one way to be sure is to ask the fact question. In reply, it
may be said that questions which call for the use or organization
of facts demand not only the knowledge demanded by the
fact question, but the more significant use of these data. It is
true that some teachers still hear lessons. On the whole, there
is too much telling of what the book says and too little teaching.
The skillful teacher, in the assignment of her lesson, will
give the children problems concerning which they can find
information in their books. The recitation will demand the
answer to the questions that have been put previously, as
well as to such other questions as may be necessary in the
development of these problems. If the book is to be given a
larger place, the recitation may be topical. Here, again, the
large topics which are assigned should demand not a repetition
of the headings and paragraphs of the book, but rather the outline
furnished by the teacher, or, better still, made by the class;
should necessitate a reorganization of the material of the text.
There is little use in trying to furnish children with the knowledge
of an encyclopedia. They will forget all except that
which has become part of a system or scheme of ideas which
have meaning and significance because of their organization.
It is true that facts are the raw material of thinking, and it is
equally true that those facts which have had some place in our
thinking are the ones which we retain for future use.</p>

<p>Aside from the form of the question, the teacher must consider
the technique of questioning. One of the most common
mistakes is to call on the bright children almost to the exclusion
of the less capable. The writer has repeatedly followed closely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
the distribution of questions among the members of a class,
only to discover that often from one fourth to two thirds of
the class were not called upon at all, and that generally three
fourths or more of the questions were addressed to a very small
number of children. Most teachers would find it interesting to
keep a record for a few days of the number of questions assigned
to each child. Such a score would help to explain the lack of
interest and backwardness of some pupils.</p>

<p>One hesitates to suggest that questions should not be given
to the pupils in any regular order from the beginning to the end
of the class by rows of seats or otherwise. Of course the teacher
who does this notifies the members of the class that they need
not be troubled about the work until their turn comes. Almost
as bad, from the standpoint of maintaining the feeling of responsibility
by the whole class, is the method of asking questions
which prefixes the question with the name of the child
who is to answer. When the teacher says, “George, will you
summarize the points which have just been made,” John,
Henry, Mary, Catherine, and all the rest realize that there is
nothing for them to do. The teacher should rather announce
her question, and then wait long enough for all to be active
before calling on any one.</p>

<p>Another source of lack of attention is found in the question
which is repeated. Children soon come to know whether they
must listen when the question is first put, or whether they may
wait until the second or third statement before they will be
called upon. There is another weakness often shown in repeating
questions, viz.: the question is varied in form, which,
in some cases, leads to confusion in the minds of attentive
pupils, or the different forms used enable the child to guess the
answer which is desired. To repeat questions is to acknowledge
either that the form in which it was first put was not
good or that the children were not expected to attend to the
first statement of the problem. Either alternative will be
avoided by a thoughtful, well prepared teacher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>The besetting sin of most teachers is the practice of repeating
the answers given by children. If the recitation is a place
where children are to discuss their problems together, then
every answer should be addressed to the whole class, not to the
teacher. The teacher who repeats each answer cannot expect
the children either to recite to the class or to pay attention to
the one who is speaking. Here is another chance for an interesting
experiment. Score one every time you repeat an answer,
and then try to see how soon you can eliminate this bad habit.
It is often helpful to stand or sit in some part of the room not
directly in front of the class. The fact that the teacher is
among the class, one of them at least in position in the room,
will make it somewhat easier for children to talk to the whole
group. This habit of repeating the answer really grows out
of the feeling which so many teachers have that the function
of questions is to test for facts, and that in the recitation the
answer should be addressed to the teacher and given by her
to the class so that all may be made aware of the correct answer.
The position which has been maintained is that the main purpose
of questioning is to stimulate thought. Even if questions
were mainly useful as a means of testing for facts, it would still
be unwise to repeat the answers.</p>

<p>Questioning by the teacher which does not lead to the asking
of questions by pupils is unsatisfactory. If the children are
thinking, really trying to solve the problem at issue, they will
have questions of their own. If any single test were to be
applied to the strength of the teacher’s questions, this would
probably be best. Needless to say, the questions which children
ask should, as a rule, be addressed to the class, or to some
one member of the class, and not to the teacher. Some of the
best lessons are those which end with children’s questions still
unanswered, these problems furnishing the point of departure
for the study which is to precede the next day’s work.</p>

<p>If any one thinks that questioning is a simple matter, one
that deserves less consideration than has been given to it, let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
him sit down and write four or five good questions which might
be used in teaching a first-grade lesson on the dog; a fifth-grade
lesson on the Southern states; a seventh-grade lesson on making
jelly; or a high school class on the law of gravity. The
teacher who will get some one to write down for her the questions
which she asks in a single recitation will be surprised
both at the number (it will be almost unbelievably large) and
the quality of the product.</p>

<p>There is nothing more searching than to attempt to write
down beforehand the half dozen or more pivotal questions
which are to be used in a recitation. When the attempt is
made, any weakness in knowledge, in organization of subject
matter, or in appreciation of the pupil’s point of view with
relation to the material to be presented, will become apparent.
There is no one thing that a teacher can do which will bring a
greater reward in increased teaching power, than systematically
to prepare questions for one or more recitations each day. If
the writer could be sure that any group of teachers would try
conscientiously to improve in the art of questioning, he would
be just as sure that these same teachers would be rated by any
impartial critic as superior to those who are willing to trust
to inspiration in this most important part of the teacher’s work.</p>

old ballads has been given before. The text used was Seward, <cite>Narrative
and Lyric Poems</cite>, pp. 20-35.</p>


<p class="p1"><em>Teacher</em>: Before we begin to talk about modern ballads, let’s see
what you got from your first impression of the old ballads last time.
In the first place, give four or five subjects that the old ballad writers
were especially interested in.</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Fighting, principally, and some romance.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: What do you mean by <em>romance?</em></p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: <em>Romance</em>—that is all.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: People meant different things—fighting, or love—do you
mean <em>love?</em></p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: No, fighting—romance. (<em>Teacher writes on board</em> “romance.”)
That is about all I know, in the first—old ballads; oh, yes,
one gruesome one, about c—.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Corbies?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Yes.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Horror, perhaps.</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Yes.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Elsworth?</p>

<p><em>Elsworth</em>: It only happened once,—lovers separated and met again.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Yes. (<em>Writes</em> “Fighting, Tales of Horror, Shipwreck, Parted
Lovers.”) Is that a fair list? I should think so. Let us see about the
spirit in which they were written, that is, the kind of qualities the people
in those ballads showed, and the kind of qualities in human nature
people of that day liked.</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: I think bravery.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em> (<em>writing</em> “bravery”): Anything else?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: A hero and a villain.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Hero and villain; in other words, you take sides?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Yes.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: What other qualities besides bravery?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Treachery, of the kind in the ballad of Johnnie Armstrong.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Yes, and the hero shows what quality?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: He believes in the king even when he is summoned before
him.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Good faith on one side, and treachery on the other. Anything
else?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Honor.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Honor, yes. (<em>Writes</em> “honor.”)</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: A great deal of honor among themselves.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Loyalty to each other; and as regards their enemies, what?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: They used to fight for fun, and they had certain rules; they
were not really angry, they had to keep certain rules.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: In other words?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: They couldn’t do just as they wanted to.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: There were rules of honor even toward your enemy, a sort
of amateur spirit.</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Courtesy to their enemies.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Courtesy,—and perhaps we might say this includes being
true to the rules. Could we say anything about the style in which
these poems were written, kind of language, and kind of verse form?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Could be put to music.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Easy to sing, for one thing?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Yes.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Complicated tunes, or simple?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Simple.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: How about the words, the English?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Old English and Scotch.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Old English and Scotch; easy or hard to understand?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: After you have read two or three, I don’t think it is hard.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: If you had been an old Scotchman of those times, should
you say they were written in hard or easy language?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Simple,—quaint.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Simple and quaint—old-fashioned. Let us turn to the
ballads you had for to-day; see how they compare with these old ones.
The first one, <cite>Lord Ullin’s Daughter</cite>—as regards the subject matter,
is it the kind of story you think would appeal to ancient writers?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: It seems so; this one was about an elopement, they seem to
write that kind of story.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Anything else?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Shipwreck.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Do you think the old ballad writers would have been satisfied
with the way the story came out?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: I don’t think so; they liked to see their side win; the lovers
won in this case, but were drowned; I don’t think they would have
liked it that way.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: If they are going to get away from the father, they ought
to get away clear. I think that is true; things end simply in the old
ballads, it is an out-and-out tragedy or a happy ending.</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: They had some death, like Johnnie Armstrong, where the hero
was killed.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: How was he killed?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: By treachery.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Was there any here?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: No.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Were they killed through anybody’s fault, or by accident?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: By accident.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: How is it in the old ballads?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: In the first stories they were not,—a shipwreck.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: But in most cases it is a matter of somebody’s treachery.
In <cite>Sir Patrick Spence</cite> who gets drowned?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: The Scotch nobles.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: There it is the lords and all those other fine noblemen.
As far as the style goes in <cite>Lord Ullin’s Daughter</cite>, should you say that
the story goes rapidly, as rapidly as possible, or should you say that if
an old ballad singer were telling the story, there is something that could
be left out?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: I think so.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Can you see any group of verses that could be left out
without breaking the story up?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: I think where it described the boat (<em>reads</em>):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“The boat has left a stormy land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A stormy sea before her—</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">When, oh! too strong for human hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The tempest gather’d o’er her.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Those descriptions could be left out; and (<em>reads</em>):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For sore dismay’d, through storm and shade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His child he did <span class="nowrap">discover:—</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One lovely hand she stretch’d for aid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And one was round her lover.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: You think the picture of how she looked in the boat does
not count?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: I like it, but it could have been left out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: The old ballad singers would have left out that part. Are
there things in the earlier part of the poem that could be left out if you
just wanted the story?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: The first verse.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Better if they got started at once, perhaps. Miss Weiss?</p>

<p><em>Miss W.</em>: The third <span class="nowrap">verse:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“And fast before her father’s men</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Three days we’ve fled together,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For should he find us in the glen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My blood would stain the heather.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He says right after that that the horses are right behind him, so he
could have left that out.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: He spends too much time in talking to the boatman, that is
true.</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: The seventh verse.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“By this the storm grew loud apace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The water-wraith was shrieking;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in the scowl of Heaven each face</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Grew dark as they were speaking.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: You can’t help wondering why they didn’t get in the boat,
and stop talking. The old ballad writers pared it all down to nothing
but the story. Turn to the next one,—<cite>Lady Clare</cite>; would that have
pleased the old ballad writers?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: I think it would have. It is just the kind of love story they
liked,—it all turned out well.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: Turns out well in the end; and in it the lovers show what
kind of qualities?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Faithful.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: You like that?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: Yes.</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: The sort of things anybody would like, all the admirable
qualities of a good love story. I wonder if any one noticed the language
of this poem, anything that would show that Tennyson was trying to
imitate the language of the old ballads?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: “I trow they did not part in scorn.”</p>

<p><em>Teacher</em>: “I trow”—that sounds old-fashioned. Anything else?</p>

<p><em>Pupil</em>: The way he brings in the <span class="nowrap">nurse:—</span></p>

<span class="fs80">SOCIAL PHASES OF THE RECITATION</span></h2>


<p>Emphasis has already been given to the social aim in education.
This chapter will discuss in some detail the possibility of
realizing this aim through the conduct of the recitation. The
real advantage to be derived from grouping children in classes
is found in the opportunity which is afforded for exchange of
ideas. A group of children seated with faces to the front responding
to the teacher’s questions and anxious only for her approval
is an educational anomaly. The recitation is more than
a place for the teacher to test the knowledge of the children,
or to explain to them as a group some phase of their work
with which they have had difficulty. It may be well to inquire
concerning the motives which operate, the activities present,
and the results commonly achieved by the recitation.</p>

<p>In many classes children seem to feel that the main purpose
of the recitation is to please the teacher. Nor is the teacher’s
attitude different. She praises or blames in proportion as the
children answer her questions or follow her directions. Of
course there are times when it is the main business of the
teacher to test children or to direct their activity; but more
commonly it is the office of the teacher to work as a member of
a group who are working together for the realization of some
worthy end. Both teacher and pupil should be pleased when
progress is being made in the work at hand because of the
active participation of all of the members of the group.</p>

<p>There are other motives commonly operating which are
even less worthy than that of pleasing the teacher. Children
not infrequently are somewhat attentive to the work of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
class because they fear the punishment which follows failure.
The more ambitious, on the other hand, come to look upon
the recitation as an opportunity to display their superiority.
They believe, and too often they are right, that the chief end of
school work is to get ahead of some one else,—to get a higher
mark. In each of the cases mentioned, the motive is essentially
individualistic. Better have the boy at work in order
to please the teacher than to have him idle; better use punishments
and rewards and secure some results in knowledge and
habits than to fail of these desirable ends: but the socialization
of the boy and the maximum of intellectual activity for
each member of the group can only be brought about in a situation
which is genuinely social.</p>

<p>What could be more natural than that children should ask
each other questions; that they should exchange experiences;
that they should work in coöperation for the satisfaction of a
common end? This presupposes that they have a problem or
purpose which is genuine. But that is only to assume that
there is some real reason for intellectual activity. Or let us
suppose that the children are at work in order that the product
of their effort may be used in some social situation. It is not
particularly difficult under such conditions to get the liveliest
kind of discussion, to secure the most earnest coöperation, or
to have pupils themselves accept in a considerable measure
the responsibility for progress in their work.</p>

<p>This difference in attitude toward school work, if once established,
is apparent in all subjects. The work of a class in
reading or literature will be transformed when children work
together to understand and appreciate its content. Instead of
the complaint that John has lost the place, it will be discovered
that he not infrequently has a question to ask, or that he can
contribute an explanation. The writer has seen a class of
third-grade children as active in questioning each other concerning
a reading lesson as they were on the playground in inquiring
concerning the games they played or the novel experiences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
in which they were interested. The teacher had attained
this result by making the children understand that they ought
to ask each other questions when they did not understand the
thought expressed in their books, and that one of the best ways
to explain was to tell of a similar experience which they had had.</p>

<p>In a class in nature study in a fourth grade a boy told a
wonderful story of the activities of a squirrel. Ordinarily the
teacher might have been expected to tell the boy that the story
was untrue and that she did not want that kind of stories. In
this class, however, the children felt responsible for the contributions
which were made. The story had no sooner been
told than the narrator was plied with questions. Where had
he seen the squirrel? On what kind of a tree? What was the
color of the squirrel? Just when did the events related happen?
The boy could not answer these questions satisfactorily,
and finally admitted that his story had a very slight basis
in fact. The rebuke thus administered by his classmates
probably did more toward giving this boy respect for truth than
a dozen statements by the teacher that his contribution was
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>In an eighth-grade class the children were discussing the
panic of ’73. One of the boys maintained that the causes
of panics were, in general, the same, regardless of the activities
of a few individuals occupying important positions
in government or in the commercial world. His contention
was mainly that it was unfair to charge a president or a political
party with the distress occasioned by a panic, when in reality
the cause was to be found in economic conditions over
which neither president nor party had control. One of the
girls in the class objected, and cited as proof the panic of
’37, which she claimed was caused by President Jackson.
The teacher could have settled the question immediately by
an authoritative statement, which most classes of children
would have accepted. In this class, however, the teacher encouraged
the class to participate in the discussion. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
end the members of the class consulted textbooks and other
more complete histories, and reached their own decision with
comparatively little help from the teacher. The value of
this work in history consisted mainly in the fact that the children,
having once discovered the problem, felt responsible
for its solution. They were engaged in the liveliest kind of
thinking and discussion. They were learning where to go,
and what materials to use in the solution of this kind of problem.</p>

<p>Possibly work in the industrial arts offers the very best
chance for group work. At every turn in work of this kind
there is the demand for careful planning involving discussion of
ways and means, and for coöperation in the execution of the
plan. A group of second-grade children were occupied most
profitably with the partial furnishing and daily care of the
teacher’s rest room. They had first of all to decide what they
could do to make the room more comfortable or more beautiful.
They decided that they could make pillow, table, and couch
covers, and window curtains, and that they could keep the
room clean. In determining materials and design, as well as
in the execution of the work itself, there was need for coöperation.
The children gained not only in appreciation of some of
the elements of home-making, but also in ability to plan and to
work together. They were being socialized both by the content
of their work and by the method employed in executing it.
Another group of children, fifth grade, spent a number of
weeks working together in planning and building a playhouse
for the first grade. A wide-awake teacher enlisted the coöperation
of three grades in the making and selling of candy in order
to get money enough to buy pictures for the school. The
preparation of a picnic luncheon, or meal for guests invited by
the cooking class, the making of a large rug from many smaller
rugs woven in such a way as to contribute to the pattern of the
final product, the building of window boxes, the writing of the
account of an excursion or other school exercise in order that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
the best results may be brought together in the final account
which is to be used in a school paper, are examples of the kind
of work which may involve the kind of activity which makes
for present social efficiency, and, therefore, for that social efficiency
which it is the ultimate purpose of education to achieve.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to transform the recitation from a place
where lessons are heard to an active social group is to plan
definitely for a variety of contributions from the individual
members or small groups of the class. When each member of
the class studies the same pages of the same book, there is little
incentive either to try to tell well what the book contributes
to the problem in hand, or to listen to the recitation of one’s
classmates. If, however, one group of children have been referred
to one book, another to a second book, and still another
to a magazine article, to pictures, or other objective representation,
there is some reason why each should do his best in
reporting, and a genuine motive for following closely the contribution
of each member of the class during the recitation is
provided. Work of this sort is easily available in history,
geography, nature study, or manual training.</p>

<p>In the subjects which seem to lend themselves less easily to
variety in assignment, many possibilities will be found by the
teacher who is anxious to prove the efficiency of this method.
The best reading that the writer has ever seen in a third grade
was done by children who read to each other. They used the
readers in the school and books from home and from the public
library. Each child was permitted to make a selection and
submit it to the teacher for approval. Then came the period
of preparation, extending often over two or three days or even a
week. During this time the child was supposed to study the
selection carefully, learn the pronunciation of difficult words, and
practice reading the selection so that he might give pleasure
to those for whom the reading was done. The one good reason
for reading aloud is to read to an audience who cares to hear
what you have to offer. These children were participating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
in a social situation which demanded much of them, and they
enjoyed the hard work which was necessary because the motive
back of it all was genuine. In arithmetic, if arithmetic deals
with the quantitative aspect of the experiences which the children
are having, it will be possible to allow for some variety
in the work which is assigned. If the problems are real, there
will be a considerable interest manifested by the children in the
solution of the problem and the results which are secured.
Suppose a class were given a list of the articles which are to be
put in a Thanksgiving basket, with instructions to find the cost
of the basket so that a friend may pay for one of the donations
which the class plans to distribute. In such a situation the
children will be most eager to compare prices and total cost
when the class next meets for the arithmetic lesson. Of course
the carping critic will say that it is easy to devise a few cases
of the sort listed above, but that in real school work you
haven’t time to make such plans. The only answer is that
the difference between superior teaching and the kind that one
sees all too commonly is found in the ability and willingness of
the artistic teacher to be more nearly true to her ideals than
are others. Any teacher, who is sufficiently interested, can
find many situations in which she can vary the work of the
class in such a way that the recitation period shall become a
place where each member of the class brings his individual
contribution.</p>

<p>Possibly the greatest need in our schools to-day is for more
purposeful work for children. We are so much concerned
about the many things which children ought to know that we
are tempted to spend most of the time drilling children on facts
which have very little meaning for them. The demand that
the school be socialized is only another way of saying that the
work of school children should function in the school itself and
in their lives outside of school. It has seemed possible, in a
few schools, to give children opportunity in the industrial
arts to work at making something which they really want for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
themselves, or upon a project which may involve the welfare
of the group, as, for example, when they work upon school
apparatus or furniture. An eighth-grade group of boys made
the furniture for the principal’s office; the children at Hyannis,
Massachusetts, make baskets, brooms, hammocks, raise vegetables,
build a boat or a fence, as occasion demands.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> At
Tuskegee the more mature students have even burnt the
bricks and constructed the buildings for the school.</p>

<p>If a significant project in the industries is undertaken, it
may furnish the motive for doing work along many lines. The
raising of vegetables may involve arithmetic in the measuring
of beds and the buying of seeds, in finding the value of the
product, and, if the product be sold, in the keeping of a bank
account. The study of dairying might very well involve a visit
to a farm; the measuring of an acre; the estimating of the
cost of production of milk and butter; and the return from the
investment. The cost and means of transportation might be
studied; a churn, butter bowl, and paddle might be constructed;
and finally a complete account of these many experiences
might be written and printed. If children are engaged
in activities of this sort, there will be no question of socializing
the school. By the very nature of their activities children
will be led to question each other and their teachers; they will
of necessity coöperate in those phases of the work which involve
team work.</p>

<p>But it is not in the industrial arts alone that school work
may deal with genuine situations. A good teacher finds a
hundred situations in which children can write for an audience.
The writer recently attended the closing exercises of an elementary
school where the graduating class had composed a
play which they presented. The main plot of the story centered
in a prize essay contest, and, as might be inferred, the essays
which were read were those which the children had written during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
the regular class work. In geography the members of a
sixth-grade class prepared talks to accompany pictures thrown
on the screen from a lantern. In history certain incidents of
the period which a class was studying were dramatized and
presented to the whole school.</p>

<p>The president of a water company in a middle-western city
told the writer that they kept things in better shape at the water
works since they had agreed to allow the children to come to
visit the waterworks whenever a teacher chose to bring a class.
In the same city there is an unusual number of pianos in the
schools, school playgrounds are being established, parents’
associations are active in coöperation with the teachers to improve
school conditions. If one were asked to explain why the
schools in this city are better, why they are so loyally supported
and so proudly spoken of by all classes of people, the answer
would be found, I believe, in the fact that there is a closer
relationship between the school and activities outside the school
in home and city than in most other places. If teachers more
commonly had in mind the needs of the children during the
time they are not in the school, it would be easier to 
<ins class="corr" id="tn-136" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'find situtions'">
find situations</ins> in which the school activities would be significant because
of the genuine needs which are felt by the children.</p>

<p>If there were nothing gained toward socializing children
through activities involving the coöperation of the whole group,
the fact would remain that the best type of intellectual activity
can be secured only with this most genuine of all incentives.
Most people, even as adults, think better when they have some
one with whom to discuss the problem in hand. It is true,
too, that often the best teacher is one whose experience is
somewhat similar to our own and whose attitudes and difficulties
are similar to ours. Children can often interpret where
teachers fail. It cannot be too often reiterated that it is the
chief business of every teacher to render her services unnecessary.
If the children taught are not at the end of any term’s
work better able to work for themselves, more ready to take the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
initiative, more capable in defining their problems, in gathering
data, and in finding solutions than they were at the beginning
of the period, then the work has been a failure. Creative
work<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> is not done when some one stands over the child and
dictates his every step, nor does thinking consist in answering
the questions which a teacher may put concerning the facts
recorded in a text. There is entirely too much truth in the
charge which is sometimes brought against our schools, that
they fail to keep alive the intellectual activity which is natural
to childhood.</p>

<p>We must never lose sight of the fact that a child who is
vigorous intellectually, actively sympathetic with those causes
which make for the general welfare, and able and willing to
work in coöperation with others, even though this may mean that
he subordinate himself to others for the time being, is the type
of individual upon which our democracy depends for its perpetuation
and for its future progress. It is necessary to emphasize
the social side of school life because we have, in our
anxiety to impart information and form habits, neglected this
aspect of school life. The pity of it all is that in neglecting the
child’s social development we have done less efficient work in
the fields we sought to emphasize because of the lack of genuine
motive. Whether we are concerned with habits, with the
acquisition of knowledge, with development in clear thinking,
or in fixing ideals, the maximum of return will be secured in the
genuinely social situation. Children working together on real
problems are being socialized through participation in social
activities. There is no other way in which the school can
contribute so certainly to the accomplishment of the aim of
all education.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE PHYSICAL WELFARE OF CHILDREN</span></h2>


<p>Intellectual development, and more especially intellectual
efficiency, are conditioned in no mean degree by one’s physical
condition. Schools have too frequently, and with justice,
been accused of producing physical defects in children. It is
coming to be recognized that we must in increasing measure
take account of the hygienic conditions under which school
work is done, as well as provide for the elimination or amelioration
of physical defects. We now have open-air schools for
consumptives, medical inspection, and dental clinics. There
are some schools which provide school lunches at a nominal
price or without cost to the pupils. Corrective physical
training is coming to be recognized, along with special playground
work. Everywhere appreciation of the importance
of physical health as a condition prerequisite to intellectual
vigor is leading those who have the welfare of the community
at heart to demand that active measures be taken to protect
and nourish the bodies of school children. It is the purpose of
this chapter to indicate briefly the relation of teachers to this
movement for physical well-being.</p>

<p>The demand that light be sufficient and that it come from
the right direction is familiar to all teachers. It may be argued
that teachers cannot control the lighting of their rooms.
The author has known teachers who have had blinds properly
placed, walls and ceilings painted or papered with respect to
proper distribution of light. Some teachers have even been
instrumental in securing alterations in buildings or the erection
of new buildings. Teachers who know that the area of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
windows should be one fourth of the floor space, that the light
should be admitted from one side of the room, and that it
should come over the children’s left shoulders, may not be
able to meet all of these conditions; but they can do all that
is possible to ameliorate defects, and can call attention to the
dangers which the situation possesses for their pupils’ eyesight
by giving or having given tests and making known the results.</p>

<p>Modern school buildings are built with artificial ventilating
systems. The success with which any system works depends
in no inconsiderable measure upon the teacher. By opening
windows in one room the efficiency of the ventilation of all
other rooms in the building may be impaired. Failure to note
the temperature may mean that children and teacher are suffering
from a condition easily remedied by the janitor or engineer.
Every teacher should have the temperature of her room
recorded on the blackboard, where every one can see it, at least
twice during each school session. Needless to say, the thermometer
should be accurate, and, if possible, hung in the center
of the room, not more than four or five feet from the floor.</p>

<p>Teachers are responsible for right habits of posture. If seats
need to be adjusted, the teacher should note the fact and notify
the principal. Although special cases may demand expert
advice and care, the teacher must hold herself responsible for
the posture of the majority of the class. Defects of vision may
be either the cause or the effect of improper position of the body,
and should bring from the teacher an urgent appeal for careful
examination and correction. Frequent rest periods should be
provided, the habit of correct posture insisted upon, and simple
corrective exercises given by the teacher.</p>

<p>Schoolrooms are not infrequently the center of infection for
the community. Any teacher can insist upon separate drinking
cups, if sanitary fountains are not provided in the building.
When a child appears with a rash, with an abnormal temperature,
and not infrequently with <em>only</em> a cough, the teacher
should appeal to the principal, the health inspector, or others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
in authority for the elimination of the child from the group.
The author has been in schoolrooms where two or three children
in the incipient stages of whooping cough were allowed to
infect the whole class. A school superintendent was distressed
with what proved to be a veritable scourge of scarlet fever in
one of his schools. Upon visiting the school he found one child
on the playground proudly showing the other children how he
could take flakes of skin from his arm. No one expects teachers
to be expert diagnosticians, but any teacher should acquaint
herself with the more common indications of childish diseases,
and should act promptly when her suspicion is aroused, even
though she prove to be wrong in half the cases. If anything
is wrong, eliminate the child from the group, suggest that a
physician be consulted, and await developments: this is the
only safe rule.</p>

<p>In addition to her activity in eliminating contagious diseases,
the teacher may often be the first to detect deficiencies in sight
or hearing. Children who are inattentive and apparently dull
may often be found to hear indistinctly. A very simple test
for hearing is to tap a pencil against a desk out of sight of the
child, and ask him to tell how many taps he hears. Headaches,
squinting, the position in which the book is held, often
indicate to the teacher eye deficiency which parents have not
suspected. Any child who gives indications of eye trouble
should be tested by teacher or principal, and, if any indications
of difficulty are found, the parents should be urged to consult
a competent oculist.</p>

<p>Dr. William H. Allen gives the following suggestions to
teachers who would discover cases of adenoids and enlarged
tonsils:<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“1. Inability to breathe through the nose.</p>

<p>“2. A chronically running nose, accompanied by frequent nosebleeds
and a cough to clear the throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>“3. Stuffy speech and delayed learning to talk. ‘Common’ is pronounced
‘cobbed,’ ‘nose,’ ‘dose,’ and ‘song,’ ‘sogg.’</p>

<p>“4. A narrow upper jaw and irregular crowding of the teeth.</p>

<p>“5. Deafness.</p>

<p>“6. Chorea or nervousness.</p>

<p>“7. Inflamed eyes and conjunctivitis.”</p>
</div>

<p>Any one who has known a child with a bad case of adenoids
or enlarged tonsils, and who has followed the progress of the
same child after the removal of the defect, will not think it
too much trouble to insist that suspected cases receive the
attention of a physician. In these cases, and where the child
is suffering because of the ills superinduced by bad teeth,
the teacher must work with the parents. Often through
mothers’ clubs or parents’ associations, addressed by a physician
and by teacher, the necessity for action, from a purely economic
point of view, if from no other, can be impressed upon
parents. It is possible that we shall have to resort to an
appeal to private charity to save the child, or perhaps we shall
in time have free compulsory dental, surgical, and medical
clinics.</p>

<p>The children are society’s greatest asset, from whatever point
of view we consider them, and teachers should be most active
in all movements which make for child welfare. There is no
other group of people better acquainted with the needs of
children, none other which stands in so strategic a position with
relation to parents and the community at large. Parents
should be taught the necessity of plenty of sleep, wholesome
food, and clean skins for children. Better devote time and
energy to this education of parents than attempt to teach
children handicapped by the lack of proper living conditions.
The anti-tuberculosis campaign, the pure milk crusade, the
demand for medical inspection, should be earnestly supported,
if not instituted, by the teachers of children. Health is not
an individual matter. The welfare of the whole group is bound
up in conditions which spell disaster for the individual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>Finally the teacher has a right to good health. Living
under bad hygienic conditions, with children who are unclean
and diseased, should not be demanded of any teacher. The
efficiency of the work which the teacher does, no less than that
of the children, is conditioned by her health. If it is true that
the teacher may suffer because of diseased children, it is none
the less true that a teacher in poor physical condition injures
all of the children she is pledged to help. Happy, healthful
lives for children and teachers is a condition which will be
brought to pass when all teachers work for this end.</p>

<span class="fs80">MORAL TRAINING</span></h2>


<p>Character building must always be recognized as a most
important function of the school. It is a mistake to divorce
the intellectual training of children from growth in morality.
If our country demands increased industrial intelligence, the
training of men and women for leadership in manufacture,
trade, and commerce, much more must it demand citizens
of sterling character. Industrial and intellectual supremacy
can mean nothing to a nation unless righteousness prevails
both in public and in private life. The idea that the schools
of our democracy are to train for citizenship has always been
interpreted to mean an education which will fit for a life of
service to the best interests of humanity. The fact that religious
instruction, as such, is barred from our schools, does
not mean that we are as a people irreligious, much less that
we undervalue the significance of the moral training of our
children.</p>

<p>School conditions offer advantages for moral training, even
though the overemphasis on intellectual attainments may at
times seem to give the teacher little opportunity for work in
this direction. The fact of a group of children who may learn
to work together, to help each other, to respect each other’s
rights, to serve the best interests of the whole group, in fact
a situation which demands just those virtues which are demanded
in society outside the school, makes the school in
some respects an ideal situation for training in morality. Of
course it is possible that the demand for intellectual attainment
may so occupy the mind of the teacher that she will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
resort to repression in order to get results in habits and knowledge.
It is true, too, that the curriculum may be so narrow
as to give less opportunity than might be desired for the type
of activity which best lends itself to the development of social
virtues. But if adverse conditions hinder somewhat the work
of the teacher, they cannot deny a very important place to the
school in the formation of character.</p>

<p>The increased responsibility of the school for the moral
training of children becomes apparent at once when the influence
of the home and the church of to-day are contrasted
with the strength which these institutions once possessed.
Regret it as much as we may, neither home nor church is as
potent in the development of morality as they once were.
Before the dominance of the factory system the boy or girl
who participated in the activities of the home gained in appreciation
of necessity for coöperation and in understanding
of his responsibility to the group in a way that is denied the
modern child. To be a party to those industries through
which food was secured, clothing obtained, and shelter provided
meant the exercise of all of the social virtues. It was fitting
under such a régime that the school should devote itself
largely to the tools of learning. But under our present conditions
the demand is insistent that the school provide, in
some measure, through its curriculum, its organization, and
by means of its methods of instruction, for the development
of the attitude of responsibility, and that positive morality
which places a premium upon doing good.</p>

<p>Let us inquire still more closely concerning the conditions
under which moral training must be effected in the school.
First of all there is the fact of heredity. The children with whom
we work are different by nature, and nothing that we can do
will make them all alike. Then, too, there is the added factor
of training before the school age. Many children come to
school with bad habits and low ideals. The one thing that
every teacher ought to realize as fundamental in moral training<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
is the fact that differences in children must be met by a
corresponding difference of appeal on the part of the teacher.</p>

<p>Over against the differences due to heredity and previous
training, there is to be found the common instinctive equipment.
Children instinctively imitate, construct, collect,
inquire, emulate, sympathize, contest, wonder, are proud, and
the like. This instinctive equipment furnishes the basis for
actions which in turn become habits. The problem of the
teacher is to use these instincts in securing desirable responses.
Of course, undesirable responses have their basis in instinct.
Here it is the business of the teacher to make the undesirable
response result in discomfort, or, better, to substitute a desirable
response. To be too proud of one’s attainment as contrasted
with others may be unlovely, but to be proud of work
better done to-day than yesterday is a positive virtue resting
upon the same instinctive foundation. The teacher may be
worried because of the imitation of that which is socially undesirable,
but she may use this same tendency to react to produce
the social graces. There are cases in which the attempt
to substitute may fail, and the necessity for inhibition by
accompanying the undesirable response by unpleasant results
arise. The important thing is not to neglect this instinctive
equipment. The tendencies shown in childhood furnish the
one basis for moral development, and their neglect may result
in lack of moral strength throughout the life of the
individual.</p>

<p>Besides the differences among individuals, there are differences
corresponding roughly to stages of development. The
authority which is accepted without question by children of
six will be seriously questioned by the adolescent. Children
grow not only in their ability to judge of the right action, but
also in their demand that authority be amenable to reason.
There can be no doubt but that rational morality is the type
which the school should attempt to develop. To this end it
is essential that the responsibility of children for their own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
actions and for the welfare of the whole group should increase
as they pass through the school. There is a possibility of
controlling little children through fear, but the time comes
when threats no longer avail. It is a sorry spectacle to see
a mature individual who must still be controlled by fear of
the results which will follow misconduct. It may be questioned
whether the continued use of corporal punishment
may not result in arrested development in morality. The
desire for social approval develops throughout the school
period. When children or adults fail to see the reasonableness
of a demand, this appeal to approval of the group may be
most effective in securing desirable responses. The rule which
the teacher must follow is never to appeal to a lower motive
when a higher may be used. Fear, respect for authority,
faith in the wisdom of the one directing, desire for social
approval, ability to pick out the essentially moral element in
the situation, and desire to act in accordance with one’s best
judgment,—thus runs the hierarchy of motives which control.
In any group some children can be appealed to by one motive
and some by another. The teacher who is developing moral
strength in the group will constantly seek to appeal to the
children on a plane just higher than that which they have
hitherto occupied.</p>

<p>Another factor which plays an important part in conditioning
the work of the school in developing morality is the
generally accepted standards of the community. Social
heredity furnishes the basis for belief in the continued development
of society. The progress that has been made, the
standards once established, become the common heritage of
the members of the group. Drunkenness is no longer considered
gentlemanly; we do not lie to our enemies when they
have a right to know the truth; our ideal of civic righteousness
demands that a man be as honest when he serves the whole
people as he is when he deals with individuals. The importance
of this factor of environment in determining the moral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
life of the individual is admitted even by those who emphasize
most strongly the importance of original nature. For the
school it gives hope because of the influences which may there
be brought to bear upon the child; and it adds a problem,
because the school may not ignore the home or the street from
which the child comes. It does not seem unreasonable to
expect that teachers will at no far distant day become most
active in all activities which make for better, cleaner, more
worthy surroundings for the children whom they attempt to
train during a relatively small part of their waking hours.</p>

<p>The physical condition of children and teacher has much
to do with the possibility of effective school work, and training
in morality is not an exception to the rule. There is not
much use in trying to form moral habits, nor in asking children
to form moral judgments, in a room filled with foul air, with
the temperature above seventy-five. Poor physical condition
on the part of the teacher is often responsible for lack of control
on the part of children. A nervous, worn-out teacher is
apt to nag, is almost sure to magnify insignificant acts, and
by virtue of her lack of control of herself is in no position to
control or instruct children. It would seem at times that we
need medical care for teachers even more than for children.
One child in poor physical condition may be hard to manage,
and may fail to gain much either intellectually or morally
from the school; but one teacher in poor physical condition
may do positive injury to a roomful of children. A few days
with a dyspeptic teacher may mean the formation of bad habits
which it will take weeks or even months to eradicate.</p>

<p>We are beginning to realize that there is a direct relation
between hygiene and morality. The underfed, overworked,
physically unfit are so frequently immoral that we had almost
charged their condition to their immorality. In doing so we
were often confusing cause and effect. However the problem
may be solved so far as adults are concerned, we are satisfied
that children of school age are entitled to happy, healthful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
lives in so far as it is possible to achieve this result. The work
done to secure better physical conditions, both in school and
at home, is probably as significant for the morality of children
as is any instruction that is given; and such care for the
physical welfare of children is the condition without which we
have no right to expect them to grow morally strong.</p>

<p>While all are agreed as to the necessity for moral training in
our schools, there is a difference of opinion concerning the
method to be used. One school advocates direct moral instruction
by means of fairy tales, history, and other stories, and
by moral precepts. The advocates of this form of instruction
believe that they can in this way make children understand
clearly what is right, and because of the emotional reaction
produced by tale or story the children will not only know the
right, but will also want to do right. Those who believe in
indirect instruction find in the regular work of the school, in
the teaching of all subjects, as well as in the control of the children
in school, the best opportunity for moral instruction.</p>

<p>With regard to the direct method, it seems to the writer
that it is assumed that “to know right is to do right.” So far
as the emotion aroused by a story of bravery, or honesty, or
temperance is concerned, the chances are that it will have
entirely evaporated before any occasion for action is found.
And right here is one very great danger in this sort of instruction.
To have the emotions aroused without any outlet in
the corresponding action may result in developing individuals
who are entirely satisfied with the emotion. They learn to
delight in emotions, and lack efficiency in action. The time
to tell the story of bravery is when bravery is 
<ins class="corr" id="tn-150" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'actally demanded'">
actually demanded</ins>; or for the child who knows the story simply as a story and
without any attempt to use it to teach morality, the story may
be referred to when this virtue is demanded. Likewise with
the moral precept. For one who has had some experience in
acting in accordance with his best moral judgment, the precept
may be used as a significant generalization. Honesty may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
the best policy after you have won in the struggle and have
the approval of conscience, and of those whose judgment you
value. You may be ashamed to be designated by the name
of the unlovely character in the story, when you are really
guilty of his weakness of character. It would seem safer, from
what we know of the emotions, to assume that actions are
responsible for emotions rather than to expect the emotion to
produce the corresponding action.</p>

<p>In support of the indirect method of teaching morality, it
may be argued that the school presents continually a situation
in which moral action is demanded.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It is possible, of course,
to deny to children any considerable responsibility for their
actions. Children who are hedged about by rules and regulations,
who are constantly directed and commanded by the
teacher, will grow little in power to form correct moral judgments.
But the ideal school is in fact a society, and the demand
for moral activity, and consequently the chance to grow
in morality, is as great as in any other life situation. It must
be remembered, too, that the main purpose of the moral training
which the school gives is to make moral growth continuous.
New situations will demand new adjustments, and it is not
possible to supply the child with a morality which will be sufficient
for his future needs. The one preparation which will
certainly be effective in making possible later growth is to be
found in the moral action of to-day.</p>

<p>The subjects of instruction lend themselves to moral training.
Moral strength depends upon interest in those activities
which make for social welfare, in the exercise of judgment in
determining the course of action which will contribute most
to the general welfare, and in action in accordance with the
judgment rendered. Our course of study contains much which
should result in increased appreciation and sympathy in the
activities which characterize our modern society. Geography,
history, nature study, literature, all deal with men in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
relationship with one another in a common environment. If
teaching means anything more than gaining knowledge,
the method employed in school subjects cannot be without
moral significance. Teachers who demand accuracy, who are
more interested in the truth of history than in a moral tale,
who are open-minded rather than dogmatic, who seek to exalt
the intellect and to hold the emotions under control, are doing
more effective moral teaching than those who preach by the
hour.</p>

<p>As has already been indicated,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> the ordinary school work
lends itself to the development of positive moral virtues. To
work together, to contribute to the welfare of the whole group,
to determine conduct in view of the possible effect on others,
is to exercise those virtues which are demanded in all social
situations. Pride and joy in one’s work and contempt for the
shirker are as natural in school as in any other situation. The
so-called school virtues of punctuality, regularity, obedience,
and industry are virtues outside of schools by virtue of the same
sanction which gives them validity in the school society. It
is important to realize that many of these virtues must be
reduced to the basis of habit in order to be most effective.
Acts of kindness, courtesy, punctuality, repeated often enough,
become second nature. They need no longer to be thought
about.</p>

<p>In the field which requires judgment, it is also true that one’s
attitude may become habitual. Much which we call morality
can be accounted for by taste. Many boys and girls have
been saved the struggle through which others pass by ideals
and contempts which they have derived from their associates.
Fortunate, indeed, is the boy or girl who can say: “The members
of our set do not frequent saloons, do not lie or cheat,
play fair, work hard, dare to do right.” All of us tend to derive
our moral code from the group of people with whom we
are constantly associated. There is honor even among thieves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
because they have a code which they respect. The teacher
who secures the coöperation of the leaders of the group can
modify, indeed transform, the moral attitude of a class by
this appeal to the code which the whole group accepts and upon
which the leaders insist.</p>

<p>The highest type of moral action is that which involves
judgments of worth. When one asks himself the question, is
this right, will it be for the general welfare, and then acts in
accordance with that judgment, he has performed an essentially
moral act. Training for this sort of action is of the same
sort that is demanded wherever the judgment is involved. The
child must be taught to analyze the situation and to pick out
the essentially moral element. The writer once knew a high
school class who habitually cheated in examinations. They
said that they were getting ahead of the teacher. The principal
explained that they were dishonest, that cheating was stealing.
The attitude of the class changed. They responded to
this analysis of the situation which pointed out the moral element.
What we call thoughtlessness and the sowing of wild
oats is often to be explained by the lack of analysis which makes
prominent the moral significance of the contemplated action.
The school should give opportunity whenever possible, whether
in ordinary schoolroom work, on the playground, or with reference
to extra-school activities, for the exercise of the moral
judgment. Power to analyze new situations and to act morally
depends entirely upon previous judgments and actions.</p>

<p>Any discussion of moral training would be incomplete which
did not take account of the reformation of the wrong doer
through school punishments or discipline. “Discipline and
punishment are teaching processes as much as are grammar or
arithmetic lessons, and when we remember that conduct and
behavior is the whole of life, we must welcome the occasions for
discipline, and even for punishment. No sane person is glad
that a child’s instincts, impulses, and habits have taken wrong
forms, but the real teacher is glad that these forms manifest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
themselves, so that they may be worked over into correct reactions.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
The key to the situation is found in placing the responsibility
with the child. If a wrong has been committed,
either he has failed to think of the moral significance of his act,
or he has chosen to do wrong. In the one case reformation may
be brought about by making clear the nature of the act; in the
other the child must will to do differently, and must by his
own act regain his place in the group whose welfare he has
transgressed. What the ordinary situation demands is more
of thinking on the part of children and less of resentment and
anger on the part of teachers.</p>

<p>Punishments need to be differentiated to fit the child. The
writer has known boys in active rebellion against school authority
who would accept corporal punishment rather than give
any evidence of intention to submit. In such a case this form
of punishment was justified. Happily such cases are rare with
the teacher who knows how to work with children. Even in
cases where the offense is seemingly identical, the punishment
must be varied to suit the individual to be reformed. Suggestion
may suffice for one, another may be persuaded, and still
another must be labored with at length in order that the judgment
which the teacher has passed may be accepted by him as
valid. In any event it is the thoughtful individual, who has the
habit of analyzing the situation when in doubt, and then acts
in accordance with his judgment, which it is the purpose of the
school to develop.</p>

<p>The importance of the moral influence of the teacher has
always been recognized. At times, however, the negative
rather than the positive factors have been emphasized. It is
well enough to demand that the teacher be free from vices,
petty or great; but it is even more important to inquire concerning
the positive virtues which characterize the instructor
of children. We may hope that our schools will develop open-minded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
children, provided the teachers are not dogmatic.
Courage, industry, integrity, are fundamental virtues. Does
the teacher possess them? Sympathy with all activities which
make for public good is demanded of all in a democracy. Does
the teacher participate, is the teacher a factor, in those movements
which make for improvement in the community? The
ideal teacher is an intelligent, hard-working public servant,
whose field of endeavor is limited only by the needs of the community
which he serves. The number of teachers who have
thus exalted the office of teacher in the community is happily
increasing. The moral effect upon the lives of children of
association with such a man or woman cannot be overestimated.</p>

<span class="fs80">CLASS MANAGEMENT</span></h2>


<p>In any discussion of class management it is necessary to
distinguish clearly between organization and control as a means
and as an end. Much of the discussion of school and class
management assumes that its sole purpose is found in economizing
time and energy for teacher and pupils. Class management,
from this point of view, is important as the means without
which effective work cannot be done in the school. Such a
view neglects to consider the opportunity afforded in managing
a class for growth on the part of pupils in the power of self-control.
Any school which plans to reproduce in its life the
conditions commonly found in life outside of the school must
allow children to accept responsibility for their own acts, and
will, therefore, look upon management as an end.</p>

<p>The discussion has not been wholly one-sided. At times
there has been considerable controversy concerning the kind of
management which was most to be desired in the schoolroom.
Those who have thought of management as a means only have
been apt to overemphasize routine; while those who have
thought only of the opportunity afforded for growth in self-control
have neglected to realize the importance of habit in
situations which are invariable. The adherents of the one
type of control want everything done at the tap of the bell, in
accordance with the rules which have been made by the teacher.
Their opponents would do away with “mechanized routine,”
and would expect children to exercise their judgment as each
question arises. This difference in point of view is easily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
reconciled when we look at management now as a means and
again as an end.</p>

<p>If a fire drill is to be effective, every one must drop the work
in hand when the signal is given and march out of the building
in an order and by a route which has been determined previously
and from which there is no variation. Here we have
the best example of management as a means. There can be
no question in this situation concerning the right of the individual
to exercise his judgment. The safety of all depends
upon the absolute following of rules, upon the degree to which
the response to the fire drill has become a matter of habit.
If we analyze this situation, we will discover the elements
which characterize situations in which we are to look upon
management as a means. In these situations we should strive
to secure habitual responses.</p>

<p>In the first place the response demanded is invariable. It
will not do to march out of the building one way to-day and
another to-morrow. The class may not go before or after its
place in the line. The speed with which the building is emptied
depends upon every individual. Here we have the second
element: the welfare of the whole group demands that the
situation be followed always by a certain response.</p>

<p>Let us examine now some of the schoolroom situations in the
light of these criteria. In passing books, paper, pencils, and
the like, a definite order should be followed. In this situation
the end desired is invariable. What is wanted is to place the
desired material in the hands of each pupil with as little delay
as is possible. The welfare of the whole group depends upon
this invariable response upon the part of each pupil. If any
one fails to do his part, there is delay and loss of time in the
work which it is desired to accomplish. For the same reasons
it is wise to have a definite order in getting wraps, a rule concerning
the manner of passing in the room, the habit of rising
and facing the majority of the class when reciting, and the
like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>Let us now examine other situations which afford an opportunity
for the exercise of self-control, in which management is
an end. In some schools children are formed in lines five minutes
before the hour and marched into the building. There is
no good reason why children should march into the building.
The end desired, that they all be in their places promptly,
can be secured by ringing a warning bell and requiring that
all enter the building as they see fit and be in their places on
time. In the latter instance they have a chance to act as normal
human beings who accept and fulfill their responsibility to
themselves and to the group. The desired end is secured, and,
far more important, the children are learning to exercise that
self-control which is demanded outside of school. Of course,
it may be objected that it is much easier to control the children,
if you march them into the building. The answer is found by
suggesting that the school does not exist primarily for the ease
of teachers, but rather for the development of socially efficient
children.</p>

<p>A principal who had some difficulty in having the boys come
from a somewhat distant playground promptly lined them up
for a race to the schoolhouse. They found that it took them
little more than a minute to reach their schoolrooms. The
boys understood his suggestion that the warning bell, rung five
minutes before school opened, afforded ample time to reach
their rooms and be ready for work when school opened. It
would have required less thought on the part of the principal
and less self-control on the part of the boys to have marched
them to the schoolhouse at the right time each day. Many
school situations offer similar opportunity. Passing through
halls, asking the teacher questions, leaving one’s seat for books
or materials, consulting with one’s neighbor may, in the hands
of a skillful teacher, become a most efficient means of training
children in self-control. In all such cases management is an
end, in the sense that these opportunities are sought by the
teacher because of their value in training children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>Pupil participation in school government has been much advocated
of late as the best means of securing a feeling of responsibility
on the part of pupils for the welfare of the whole
group, as well as in the exercise of self-control. As long as these
ideals control, it matters little what particular form of organization
is utilized to secure the ends desired. What sometimes
happens is an exaggeration of the importance of the machinery
of government, with a corresponding lack of self-control, or
exercise of social responsibility. The writer once visited a
school which was much talked of because of its system of
“pupil self-government.” He found there the worst bullying
of small boys by those who held offices that he has ever seen
in any school. Many of the children declared that they were
not parties to the government supposedly in control of the
school. When the teachers were absent from their rooms, the
children droned over certain set exercises which were constantly
before them and from which type of activity they were not permitted
to depart. Now these defects in school management
may not all be charged directly to the overemphasis of the
machinery of government, but they were due to the fact that
this machinery, this form, had taken the place of genuine self-government
on the part of the pupils.</p>

<p>A wise principal or teacher may secure good results by inaugurating
a system of pupil participation in school government,
but the wise guide and counsellor must be there all of
the time. Introducing children dramatically to the machinery
of government will not place old heads on young shoulders.
Children will still be childish in their judgments and in their
ideas of punishment, even though they be called senators,
aldermen, policemen, judges, and the like. The dramatization
of city or state government will undoubtedly help in the understanding
of the function of citizens and of their servants, the
officeholders. This alone would be sufficient justification for
introducing in the upper grades, in dramatic form, a system of
government, without expecting that it would in any considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
measure relieve teachers or principals of the necessity of
guiding children in their development in power of self-control,
and in their acceptance of social responsibility.</p>

<p>The same system of pupil participation in school government
will succeed with one principal and set of teachers and
fail in another situation. The results which are most worth
while, self-control and the exercise of social responsibility, will
be secured without any of the forms of civil government in one
school, while another principal will claim that success in his
school is due to his system of “pupil government.” No teacher
need feel condemned because she cannot succeed with a particular
scheme of government, and none should be unduly
elated because of the invention or use of some particular form
of organization. The essential element in school management
is found in the spirit of coöperation and helpfulness which
should actuate teachers and pupils.</p>

<p>The questions of management considered above cover much
of the ground usually considered under the head of school discipline.
The same problems, especially from the standpoint of
punishments and rewards, are considered in the chapter which
deals with the moral training of children. It may be well to
add here that the problem of discipline is largely one of good
teaching. Children who are hard at work seldom worry the
teacher. Right conditions for work may play an important
part. The consideration of some of the problems of organization
is, therefore, in place in a chapter on management.</p>

<p>The ordering of the daily program is one of the most
important elements in classroom management. The desire
for variety is strong in children, and their power to concentrate
their attention upon a single kind of work is correspondingly
short. In the primary grades periods of from eight to twelve
minutes, with a possible extension to fifteen, will give sufficient
opportunity for change of work. These periods may be lengthened
to thirty or even forty minutes in the upper grades. The
length of the period will depend upon the variety which may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
found in the work of a single period. In a reading lesson which
includes word drill, reading, and oral composition, the maximum
period may be used, while a period devoted to number drill
may be worse than useless after the first five or six minutes.
It is undoubtedly better for children to work to the maximum
of their capacity for short periods than to dawdle for twice the
time. In the upper grades twenty minutes may be as long
as children can work on the development of a difficult problem
in geography, while they may be active and willing to continue
work in a literature lesson after thirty-five or forty minutes.
The writer has seen a class of seventh-grade children who
worked consistently for forty-five minutes on a history problem
which involved discussion, map work, and the consulting
of reference works.</p>

<p>Group instruction has long been recognized by teachers of
large classes as essential to the best work. In a class of forty
or fifty children, however carefully they may have been graded
at the beginning of the year, there will appear differences in
attainment which make it necessary to divide the class into
two or more groups in some subjects, in order to work to best
advantage. In the lower grades, especially in the first, where
grading is least able to place children on the basis of their
ability, there is the greatest demand for group work. As
many as three or four classes in reading may be necessary in the
first grade. It must be remembered that such grouping should
never be made to apply to all subjects, nor is it necessary to
apply the group plan to any subject without variation. Children
divided into three groups for reading may do very well
in two for arithmetic, and may all work together in nature
study or constructive work. In reading it will be worth while
to have all work together at times on work which is possible
for the least capable and which may serve as a review for the
more advanced group.</p>

<p>By the time the fourth or fifth grade is reached, the pupils
will be somewhat more evenly graded. It will still be necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
however, to group pupils in those subjects in which the sequence
is such that the pupils’ advance depends upon the complete
mastery of the part of the subject already covered. In
arithmetic, in the more formal part of the work in English
composition, and sometimes in geography or history, two
groups are advantageous.</p>

<p>When pupils all work together it is not expected that all
will be able to do an equal amount of work. It is especially
important that provision be made for the brighter members
of the class, in order that they may have enough work to keep
them active and alert. It too often happens that in large
classes the work is scaled down to meet the ability of the
poorest half of the class, in consequence of which the brighter
pupils learn to loaf and tend to lose interest in school work.
However many groups the class may be divided into, there
will always be the necessity for individualizing the children of
each section. The brighter ones must be given assignments
which are beyond the ability of the less capable, while a minimum
of achievement must be accepted when it represents the
best effort and means the continued development of the pupil
who is weaker intellectually.</p>

<p>Good teachers provide for individual needs, not only by
grouping their classes on the basis of their ability, but also
by giving individual instruction. No daily program should
fail to provide a period during which the teacher can devote
herself to the needs of those individuals who need special
help. It may be to help the boy or girl who has been absent
on account of sickness, to explain a difficult problem in arithmetic,
to help in the interpretation of a map or diagram, or
to teach the pupil how to study; always there will be plenty
for the teacher to do who thinks of her pupils as individuals
during the half hour or more devoted to individual instruction.</p>

<p>The idea of providing individual instruction may be made
the central idea in organizing the daily program, as is done in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
the Batavia system,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> which allows one half of all school time
for individual instruction. There would seem to be little need
for devoting so much time to individual instruction in a school
having any adequate system of grading and promotion.
Indeed, as has already been pointed out in the discussion of
social phases of the recitation, there is a positive advantage
in teaching in groups. The extravagant claims sometimes
made for particular systems of organization, especially when
it is declared possible by means of the system for <em>all</em> children
to reach the same standard of excellence, bear on their face
the evidence of their fallacy.</p>

<p>Any attempt to give group or individual instruction must be
accompanied by provision for seat work for those who are not
working with the teacher. In the lower grades much has been
accomplished by allowing children to express themselves with
colored crayons and paints, with scissors and paste, as well as
with the more common pencil and paper for copying, or the
letters and words for word and sentence building. There is
probably as much worth in the seat work which results in the
expression of the ideas gained from a story by means of crayons
or with scissors as there is in the conversation concerning the
story in class. As children advance, more difficult problems
in constructive work and in study may be assigned.</p>

<p>In the intermediate and upper grades the problem of having
children occupied who are not directly under the supervision
of the teacher is largely the problem of teaching these children
to study. A child in the fourth grade ought to be able to
discover and note carefully the difficulties which the lesson
assigned presents, and he should, in some measure at least, be
able to satisfy the problems which arise. In succeeding grades,
if children are being taught to study, they ought in increasing
measure to be able to gather data, organize it, and proceed to
the solution of their own problems.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>The conduct of the recitation has been discussed at length
in preceding chapters. It may be well to emphasize here the
more essential criteria. In a well managed recitation all of
the children are responsible for the progress of the class all
of the time. To this end the teacher addresses her questions
to the whole class before calling on any individual. The pupils
are held responsible for the answers which are given. The
teacher does not constantly repeat and explain answers.
When they do not understand, children are expected to ask
each other questions. To secure these ends the class should,
when possible, be seated so that the one reciting may easily
face the other members of the class. The ideal seating is
found in the kindergarten circle. In a room with sufficient
space in front, the children may be seated or may stand in such
a way as to gain most of the advantages of the circle. If
pupils must sit in rows of seats with their backs to each other,
it may help to have the children reciting face the majority,
and to encourage those whose backs are toward the speaker to
turn in their seats. It would seem possible that we may sometime
furnish our schoolrooms with reference to our ideals of
education; that a classroom may sometime become a place
fitted for a group of children who are to work together in the
solution of their problems.</p>

<p>The lack of proper management of a class may hinder the
work of a teacher whose work is excellent in other respects;
but no skill in management, however efficient in keeping children
in order, can take the place of good teaching. Most men
and women who know how to teach learn to manage a room
full of children. There are still a few who call themselves
teachers who exalt management unduly. For them the essential
elements in school teaching are discipline, control,
organization. To the young teacher, or to the one who would
grow, the ideal of better teaching must constantly lead
toward greater efficiency. Observe any successful teacher,
and you can discover the devices of management which allow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
her to work to best advantage, and the use which she makes
of the opportunities which the school presents to develop
self-control and social responsibility on the part of her pupils.</p>

<span class="fs80">LESSON PLANS</span></h2>


<p>The best teachers never reach the point where preparation
for the day’s work is unnecessary. The teacher who stimulates
her pupils to their best effort must herself be interested
in the work in hand. If nothing new in material or method
is found to vary the work, interest soon lags. The lesson
often repeated is as dry and lacking in power to interest or
inspire as the proverbial sermon taken from the barrel. Even
when a teacher has taught a most successful lesson, it is dangerous
to try to repeat that exercise in precisely the same
way. The two situations will not be alike. The fact that she
tries to repeat will take the edge off the lesson for the teacher,
and make it correspondingly dull for the pupils. Young and
inexperienced teachers are often most successful because of the
zest with which they attack the problems which are new to
them. The older teacher may be able to keep a class in order
and teach them something with a minimum of preparation;
but her best work will be done only when she has planned as
carefully as the novice for whom the need of preparation is so
apparent.</p>

<p>The subject matter which should be drawn upon for any
lesson constantly changes. No two groups of children have
had exactly the same varieties of experience; hence the need
for varying the approach, as well as the demand for differences
in observations, experiments, reading, or other methods employed
to bring the data necessary for the solution of their
problem before children. Subject matter is growing, is being
made all of the time. Last year’s discussion of the geography<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
of Europe, of South America, of Africa, or of Asia will not
suffice for this year, because interesting and important events
have occurred in these countries during the year intervening.
For the wide-awake teacher, even that most exact of the sciences,
mathematics, represented by arithmetic in our curriculum,
will change; since the number aspect of children’s experience
will vary. If spelling means the study of words which are
needed for use in written expression, the work in spelling will
vary just as surely as the occasions for written expression
vary among children. No teacher could, if she would, repeat
a series of lessons which deal with natural phenomena. In any
field, the need for preparation becomes apparent for one who
would command the material which should be made available
for children.</p>

<p>In the preparation of a lesson plan the first and in some respects
the most important step is to become acquainted with
the subject to be taught. There is no method of teaching
which can take the place of a thoroughgoing knowledge of the
material which bears upon the topic to be treated. The
teacher who finds in the life of the children outside of school,
in school activities, in books, pictures, magazines, in study and
travel, material for her daily class work, will make any course
of study vital and interesting to children. In such an atmosphere
pupils will grow not only in knowledge, but also in
the desire to inquire and investigate and in power to satisfy
their intellectual craving.</p>

<p>After the teacher has in hand an abundance of interesting
material, the next step in the plan is to organize the data to be
presented. Some organization is usually found in textbooks
and courses of study, and it is possible simply to try to fit
any additional material which may have been collected to the
scheme provided. The difficulty with this ready-made organization
is found in the fact that it has little or no relation
to the needs or problems of the particular group of children to
be taught. Any organization which is to be significant to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
children must take account of their point of view, and attempt
to present subject matter in response to the need which they
feel for the material to be presented. This is precisely what
is meant by the difference between the logical and psychological
methods of presenting subject matter. Not that the
psychological method is illogical, rather it takes account of the
child’s needs and is for him logical beyond the most complete
adult logical scheme. It may seem logical to the adult to
teach the crayfish by calling attention to the large parts and
then to the smaller parts in order, or to deal with the structure
of the skeleton, nervous and circulatory systems, connective
tissues, and the like. To an eight-year-old child, the problems
which will probably be most logical, most satisfying to his
desire for investigation, will deal with the way in which the
crayfish gets his living, how he protects himself from his enemies,
how he brings disaster by making holes in levees, and
how important he is as an article of food. In satisfying these
childish problems, much of the information which might have
been imparted, had the adult scientific order been followed,
will be mastered by the pupils. Much more will be remembered,
because the information is associated with the solution
of interesting problems. It may seem logical in teaching
India to a sixth-grade class to treat of prevailing winds, surface
features, climate, vegetation, animals, mineral products, and
people; but the children whose teacher approached this subject
by asking them to try to discover why they have had
such terrible famines in India probably remember more of the
geography of India to-day than those who followed the adult
logical order. In organization, then, the starting point is to
get the child’s point of view, to discover his problems, and to
organize the material to be presented with reference to these
childish aims.</p>

<p>Good organization demands that material presented to
satisfy the demand made by the child’s problem be grouped
around few coördinate heads.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Many topics of equal value<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
in an outline generally indicate a lack of organization, a lack
of appreciation of the relation of the various facts to be presented.
For example, one might think of a great many facts
about plant growth; the seeds must be put in the earth, the
weather must be warm enough, they must have water, they
need to be hoed, the ground should be fertile, they need air,
they grow best when they have sunlight, they may have too much
moisture, in rocky ground the soil may not be deep enough,
they must not be too close together, weeds and insects must be
destroyed, the roots should not be disturbed, the choice of
the seed is important, and so on. For a group of lower-grade
children there are two problems; namely, (1) what
kind of plants do we want, and (2) what can we do to
make them grow well. Under the first head would come the
plants which are suitable for our conditions of soil and climate,
and the question of seed selection. Under the second head
the topics will be moisture, sunlight, air, and cultivation, including
the destroying of insects or other pests. Each of these
topics will be suggested in answer to the problems which have
been raised (what plants we want, and how we can make them
grow well) by a group of children who have had any experience
with growing plants. If any important topic is omitted, the
teacher will call for it by a question which suggests the lack of
a complete solution to the problem which is being considered.
This brings us to the next step in plan making.</p>

<p>A good lesson plan will include pivotal questions which will
serve to call for the data as indicated by the main topics given
in the organization of the subject matter. The problem of
questioning has been discussed at some length in a previous
chapter.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In planning a lesson, a question or two which will
discover to the children the problem to be solved should come
first in the plan. With the problem before the children, the
function of the question is to stimulate thought in the direction
of the solution of the problem. The writer is familiar with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
objection that questions cannot be prepared ahead of time.</p>

<p>It is true that the form of question may need to be varied
because of progress or the lack of it, not anticipated by the
teacher, but the question carefully prepared ahead of time will
help rather than hinder in the formulation of a question to meet
the situation. It is true, too, that not all of the questions can
be prepared ahead of time. All the more reason for careful
preparation of a few questions which will enable the teacher
to prevent wandering by children during the development of
the topic. Thought-provoking questions which guide and
stimulate children in the solution of their problems are dependent
upon the aim which has been established and upon
the organization of material which it is desired to follow in the
solution of the problem. One might as well deny the need
of organizing material, as to question the value of preparing
a few pivotal questions as a part of the plan.</p>

<p>Lessons often fail because the ground covered during the
period cannot be retraced by the children at the end of the
exercise. In a well-organized plan the teacher will provide for
summaries as each main point is covered. In general these
summaries should aim to recall the subject matter covered from
the beginning of the lesson. It may be suggested that any
good teacher summarizes her work as she passes from point to
point in her teaching, and that no artificial reminder is necessary.
The difficulty is that a good summary is not accomplished
merely by asking for a recapitulation of the material covered.
The skillful teacher puts her question which involves a summary
in such form that the pupils get a new view of the ground
already covered. In the experience of the writer, questions
which involve a summary of the work covered, with the added
element of a new view as a stimulus to further thought on the
subject, are more rare than good questions introducing new
topics.</p>

<p>A good plan will include a list of illustrations, illustrative
material, books including references to chapter or page, maps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
or charts which are to be consulted during the recitation.
Teacher and children are often disappointed because of the
lack of materials which could have been at hand had the teacher
only thought about the lesson before teaching it. In like
manner, the opportunities for motor expression, other than
reciting or discussing, should be noted in the plan. Dramatization,
constructive work, graphic representation at the seat
or on the blackboard, may make the difference between success
and failure in a recitation.</p>

<p>A lesson which has been well planned will naturally end in
the assignment of work to be done in preparation for the next
recitation. In the discussion of any problem there must arise
questions which cannot then be answered. A good lesson is
characterized not simply by the ability of children to report
progress, but quite as much by their statement of the questions
still unanswered. The direction sometimes given to call up
again the question which is left unanswered during the recitation
indicates a teacher whose assignments provide a real
stimulus for study in preparation for the next day’s work. If
it is necessary to have a live problem before children during
the recitation conducted by the teacher, obviously it is much
more necessary to make assignments which involve real issues
for children to meet.</p>

<p>In outline form the discussion of plan making given above
would appear as given below. This lesson on plan making
may be taken as an illustration of the type of plan a teacher
should prepare for a development lesson. In this plan, as in
others, it seems wise to keep the subject matter separate from
the method of procedure.</p>

<p><em>A plan for teaching lesson plans</em>: Their importance and the
elements which enter into their composition.</p>

<p><em>Teacher’s aim</em>: To show the importance of plan making and
to indicate the elements which enter into the construction of
a good plan.</p>

somewhat systematically?</p>

<p>The plan given above for the topic “irrigation” is typical of
many plans which the teacher should make. It indicates the
development of the whole topic, which will need the time of
several recitations for its complete development. The topics
given at the end of the plan for class study and for individual
assignment show that the teacher had thought over the problems
which might arise as the subject was taught, and that
she was ready to make such assignments as the situation demanded
from day to day. If such a list of possible assignments
has been prepared before the topic is taught, the chances
are that the ground will be much more thoroughly covered
than would be the case if the teacher trusted to her ability to
select an interesting problem at the end of each day’s work.
Lesson plans should, as a rule, cover a complete unit of work
or topic. One plan will commonly include inductive development
work in the derivation of principles, drill work to fix
these generalizations or to give skill in their application, and
at times deductive work in the use of the principles derived
to explain new situations. A complete plan for teaching percentage
in arithmetic would include all of the elements mentioned.
A lesson for appreciation or a recitation lesson may
often be followed by drill work. When the topic lesson plan
has been prepared, the teacher will need to consider from day
to day the best method of proceeding with the subject. She
may wish to vary somewhat the approach or order of development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<h3>A PLAN FOR A DRILL LESSON</h3>

<p>The work indicated here can be done in one period. The
plan is given as an illustration of the principles involved in good
drill work. It is especially necessary, in planning for lessons
of this type, to be ready to vary the exercises in order to
maintain the interest and attention of the class. Repetition
with attention is what counts for habit formation. The children
have been playing a game in which the score secured by
throwing a bean bag in squares, numbered from one to ten,
has been multiplied by two and later by three. The class has
been divided into sides, and the competition has been keen.
They want to make larger scores, and, therefore, have a compelling
motive for studying the next table.</p>

<p><em>Teacher’s aim</em>: To teach multiplication by four. If we are
to make larger scores, what table must we learn next? How
many think they can learn half of the table of fours to-day?
If you learn it, we will play our game for ten minutes.</p>

<p><em>Pupil’s aim</em>: To learn the multiplication table of fours.</p>

&#160; Teacher writes the table on the
blackboard, as indicated under
subject matter.<br>
&#160; How many are sure they know
the first two? Look at me and
answer as I ask the results. Don’t
answer unless you are sure.<br>
&#160; Now let us take the first three.
Proceed as before.<br>
&#160; I’ll erase the first three. Look
at them carefully. Now write
them on your tablets.<br>
&#160; 4 × 4 =   4 × 2 =   4 × 6 =<br>
&#160; Don’t write the answers unless
you are sure you are right.<br>
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
&#160; Let four or five children read
their answers.<br>
&#160; Margaret may ask for answers.
She drills on the first three combinations.<br>
&#160; The other two are easy to remember,—four
times three we
know; it is the same as three times
four, and four times five are twenty
we can all remember. Look carefully;
I am going to erase them.<br>
&#160; Drill by teacher on last two
combinations.<br>
&#160; All combinations put on board
again and read and written by
children.<br>
&#160; Robert tries to discover whether
there is any girl who has forgotten
any part of the table.<br>
&#160; Katharine tries to catch the
boys.<br>
&#160; All write at the dictation of the
teacher, supplying the products.
&#160; The game is then played. When
any one makes a mistake in recording
his score on the blackboard,
his side is penalized the amount of
his mistake.<br>
    </div>

<p>Possibly all the plans the experienced teacher needs for the
lesson outlined above are a few notes concerning the variations
to be introduced from time to time in the drill. She must plan,
however, to put zest into the lesson by means of the variety
which she introduces, and she must, if she is to get the best
work, provide some motive which will make the drill work
seem worth while to the children.</p>

<h3>A LESSON ESSENTIALLY DEDUCTIVE</h3>

<p>A part of a larger topic plan on taxation. The children
have begun the study of taxation by inquiring how policemen,
street cleaners, firemen, and other city employees are
paid; how money is secured to run the schools, to provide
water, and the like.</p>

<p><em>Teacher’s aim</em>: To teach how to determine the amount of
taxes to be paid when the assessed value of the property and
the rate of taxation are known.</p>

<p>George, did you find out the assessed valuation of your
father’s house and lot?</p>

<p>Henry, did you find the rate on real estate?</p>

<p><em>Pupil’s aim</em>: Let us try to find out how much tax George’s
father must pay on his house and lot.</p>


    <div class="textcol">
<p class="smcap">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Subject Matter</p>

&#160; A knowledge of percentage is
assumed.<br>

&#160; To find the percentage we
multiply the base by the rate.<br>

&#160; House is worth $3500. Rate of
taxation is $1.80 on the hundred
dollars.<br>

&#160; $1.80 &#160; on one hundred dollars<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; 35 &#160; times $1.80 would be the<br>
<span class="over">&#160; &#160; 900 &#160;</span> amount due on thirty-five<br>
&#160; &#160; 540 &#160; hundred.<br>
<span class="over">$63.00</span><br>
<br>
&#160; Taxation is simply an application
of percentage.<br>

thirty-five hundred dollars?<br>
<br>
&#160; Do you discover in this example
anything like the problems in
which you find a certain per cent
of a given sum?<br>
&#160; Find .018 (1<sup>8</sup>/<sub>10</sub> per cent) of
$3500. If you multiply the assessed
value by the rate, will you
get the amount of the tax?<br>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>b.</em> Spain’s success in
       colonization in the New World.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="textcol">
<p class="smcap">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Method of Procedure</p>
&#160; Much of the work can be developed
from assigned readings for
which the pupils must be held
responsible. Where textbooks are
not available the teacher, or a
pupil who reads well, may read to
the class. Of course, the assignment
must be very definite. For
example:<br>
<p>&#160; &#160; <em>a.</em> As you read see if you can
     tell from incidents in the
     story the kind of man King
     James must have been.
     You must argue for what
     you think about him.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; <em>b.</em> England was interested particularly
     in Spain, Holland,
     France, and the New World.
      As you read find out why
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
     this was so.</p>
&#160; Half the class may be given the
first assignment, the other half the
second.<br>
&#160; When at the close of the study
period, the teacher calls for the
work, it will be through her sequence
of questions that the subject
matter will be organized according
to the outline under
“Subject Matter.” If the discussions
are lively and argumentative,
the spirit of the seventeenth century
will be felt and the life of the
time pictured. Pictures of castles,
London streets, Ireland, the continent,
sea vessels, etc., will help
to make impressions more vivid.
Topic 6 makes a good summary
and can be conducted in a way to
make the work most attractive to
the pupils.<br>

Europe; show the Catholic
countries, show the Protestant
countries.<br>
<br>
&#160; As the teacher develops the
lesson from the class, by means
of thought-provoking questions,
she can make an outline on the
board, the class helping; then
this outline may be copied by the
pupils in notebooks used for
history lessons only. These
outlines should serve as
summaries and also as reviews
as the lessons continue.<br>

&#160; As has been indicated, where no
problem development is possible,
use textbooks or the teacher’s
wealth of details to fill in the
connecting links. The texts should
be read just when the need for the
information arises: for instance,
when it is necessary to know the
conditions of the charter granted
to Cecilius Calvert, the books
should be opened, the page found,
the page or paragraph read silently
by the class, and the information
then given.<br>
<br>      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
&#160; If the previous situations have
been vividly presented, then the
problem of the difficulties of
getting such a trip under way that
confronted Cecilius Calvert should
be eagerly discussed by the class.
There can be map work—England:
locate Gravesend, Isle of Wight;
also make the flag of England
under which the expedition sailed.
(The flag of 1608 was the united
flag of England and Scotland,
the flag of St. George and St.
Andrew combined. Lord Baltimore’s
own banner can be made
and colored, though it was not

<p>2. The voyage.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; <em>a.</em> The stop at the Barbadoes.<br>
     (It is necessary that
     the class understand
     something of England’s
     colonial territory
     at the time:
     England colonized
     Barbadoes in 1625,
     after it had been
     depopulated by the
     Spanish. The island
     had, therefore, been
     under English control
     for eight years.
     It was possible that
     the <i>Ark</i> and the
     <i>Dove</i> carried mail
     for the Barbadoes.
     The colonists
     stopped for three
     weeks, in that time
     repairing the vessels,
     securing negro
     slaves, and buying
     supplies, among
     which was seed corn
     for the Maryland
     settlement.)</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>b.</em> The stop at Point
     Comfort.—Letters from
     Cecilius Calvert and
     the king were to be
     delivered with great
     respect, by the hands
     of a messenger who
<ins class="corr" id="tn-189" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'was comformable'">
was conformable</ins>
     to the Church of England,
     to Sir John
     Harvie, the governor
     of the Virginias.</p>
<p>3. The landing on Blackiston’s
   Island, March 25,
   1634. Why not a
   suitable place for a
   permanent settlement?</p>
<p>4. The visit to the Pascataway
   Indians. The sale
   of the Yaocomaco
   Village. The advantages
   of such an
   arrangement with
   native Indians.</p>
<p>5. The settlement on St. George’s
   Creek, afterward known as
   St. Mary’s Creek. The
   settlement was named
   Augusta Carolina.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textcol">
<p>2. The voyage can be treated as
a recall of the knowledge
gained from the
celebration of a holiday
like Maryland Day in
a previous grade, or an
outline map may be
drawn and pupils may trace
the route if they can.</p>

&#160; (More map work can follow to
     indicate the stop at the Barbadoes,
the route up the Atlantic to Old
Point Comfort, another stop, and
on to Blackiston Island.)<br>

       Barbadoes planned?</p>

       Comfort planned?</p>
<br>
<p>3, 4, 5, 6. From the landing on
   Blackiston Island to the
   end of this topic the
   method followed should
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
   be: developing questions,
   with the use of a
   textbook which should
   be read either before the
   lesson or after the development
   in order to
   verify conclusions made;
   but this must be left to
   the judgment of the
   teacher and her own
   individual plan for dealing
   with the subject.

<p>7. For the life in the colonies,
reading periods may be
occupied with readings
from any good book that
gives a graphic account
of the times, such as
Alice Morse Earle’s
<cite>Home Life in the Colonies</cite>.
If the sand table
is used, the children
should consult these
books. Another way to
vary the procedure, if
there are books enough,
is to assign readings and
let the pupils bring to
the class accounts of the
details of the life in the
colonies that seemed
most interesting to them
individually.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; In the Affairs of Interest it
will be necessary for the
teacher to tell about the
conditions in England.
Mowry, Guerber, or
Warren may have all
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
the information necessary
for this purpose,
but Cheyney’s <cite>European
Background of American
History</cite> should be
studied by the teacher.
The European background
can be very
simply drawn.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; The Kent Island affair may
be read before being discussed,
but there is good
problem work there, and
the better plan would be
to read the text last.

<p>Note.—Here the development of the Maryland colony may be
closed because of the political difficulties which are entirely beyond the
experience of the sixth-year child. The French and Indian Wars might
be studied; also the opening up of western Maryland by the coming
of the Germans; but the main point has been accomplished. The children
have worked their way through the study by living in the conditions
of the colony and solving Leonard Calvert’s problems for him. To
work such a plan out in detail, to give just enough to whet the appetite
of the child and then make him think for himself, to have him live as
a colonist of the times, interested particularly in the details of government
that concern the colonists as a united body until finally a “two
house” legislature is demanded because of the growth in population,
area occupied, and interests represented, is a task for the skill of the
teacher, and is worth while.</p>

<h3>A LESSON IN NATURE STUDY INVOLVING A REAL PROBLEM</h3>

<p>This lesson was planned and taught very successfully in the
third grade by Miss Roxana A. Steele of the Speyer School,
Teachers College, Columbia University.</p>

<p><em>Teacher’s aims</em>:—</p>

<p>1. To teach pupils why and how to transplant.</p>

<p>2. To prepare for the transplanting of the salvia plants in
our school garden.</p>

<p><em>Pupil’s aims</em>:</p>

<p>1. To be able to select good plants for transplanting.</p>

<p>2. To know how to transplant in order to plant salvia plants
without help.</p>

into garden later.)<br>
&#160; <em>Advantages of transplanting</em>:<br>

<p>&#160; I. Choice of Plants.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Very small plants:</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Do not root well.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Are slow in getting started.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Large plants:</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Stalks too long and weak.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Bend very easily.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; If used, need to be planted
      deep.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Roots have not had room
      enough in hotbed.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Medium-sized, strong plants:</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Best for planting.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Good roots.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Good stalk.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Green leaves.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Crooked plants.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Can be straightened by the sun.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textcol">
<p class="smcap">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Method of Procedure</p>
&#160; What are we planning to do with
our salvia plants when they are a
little larger?<br>
&#160; Why didn’t we plant the salvia
seeds in the garden?<br>
&#160; What are some of the advantages
of transplanting? disadvantages?<br>
<br><br>
&#160; How many children feel that
they know just the best way to
transfer a plant? (Pupils’ Aim.)
Do you think we can afford to
practice with the salvia plants
when we have so few? Who can
suggest a good way to learn to
transplant?<br>
&#160; Let us look at those cabbage
and tomato plants which I have
brought from Teachers College
and see what we think about them.
These are from the box from
which plants were selected by the
gardener last week.<br>
<br>
&#160; I shall divide the plants into
small, large, and medium-sized.
Tell which you think are best for
transplanting and why.<br>
<br>
&#160; Why would you not select the
very small ones? the very large
ones?<br>
<br>
&#160; When a gardener has not enough
fine, straight plants, can you think
of a way of planting by which he
might use a crooked plant?<br>

<br>
&#160; Can you think of some things
which might help a very young

<h3>A LESSON PLAN IN GEOGRAPHY WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY
DEDUCTIVE</h3>

<p>The study of maps forms the basis for inferences which are
later verified by referring to the text. This plan was written by
Miss Mary F. Kirchwey of the Horace Mann School, Teachers
College, Columbia University. This lesson was most successfully
taught to sixth-grade pupils in the Horace Mann School.</p>

<p><em>Teacher’s aim</em>: To teach the geography of India and to give
practice in the application of principles of geography known
by the pupils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

India?</p>


    <div class="textcol">
<p class="smcap">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Subject Matter</p>
<br><br><br>
&#160; Failure of crops—dense population
directly dependent upon agriculture
for a living—lack of sufficient
means of transportation.<br>
&#160; We have abundant rainfall—
temperature favorable to crops—
great land area in proportion to
our population.<br>
&#160; In Egypt—even as far back as
in the days of Joseph (Bible)—also
in recent years.<br>
&#160; Nile’s overflow less abundant
than usual—dense population.<br>
<br><br><br><br>

&#160; Location and approximate extent
of the Indus Valley.<br>
<br><br><br><br>

&#160; Between latitudes 23° and 30° N.
the temperature is warm.<br>

&#160; Florida is in about the same
latitude, but the extremes of
temperature are not so great owing
to the water mass that surrounds it
and tempers both heat and cold.<br>

&#160; What is a famine?<br>
&#160; Sufficient conversation to

suffering attendant upon famine.<br>
&#160; What are some of the conditions
that bring about a famine?<br>
<br>
&#160; Have you ever heard of famines
in our country? Why not?<br>
<br>
&#160; In what part of the world have
you heard of famines?<br>
<br>
&#160; What were some of the causes
of famine in Egypt?<br>
<br>
&#160; The Indus Valley in India is
one of the regions that is subject
to terrible famines. Let us see if
we can find the reason for it.<br>
<br>
&#160; Point out the Indus on the map.
Where does it rise? Where empty?
Draw your pointer along the
length of the valley—across it.<br>
&#160; In what latitude is it?<br>
&#160; What temperature conditions
must prevail there? What part of
North America is in about the
same latitude? What do you know
about the temperature of Florida?
Do you think that the Indus
Valley has about the same
temperature? Look carefully at
the location of both places—
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
Florida and the Indus Valley.
Can you see any reason for thinking
that temperature is not the

affected by the waters about it?
How are the summer and winter
temperatures of the Indus Valley
affected by the land mass about it?

&#160; Rainfall.<br>
<br><br><br>

&#160; Indus Valley is in the trade wind
belt.<br>
<br>
&#160; North of the equator the trades
blow from the northeast.<br>
<br><br>
&#160; The air over the land becomes
heated and expands. The cooler
air from the water blows in.<br>
<br><br><br>

&#160; From a general southerly direction.<br>
<br>
&#160; Arrows on map show that the
winds come from the southwest.<br>
<br><br>

&#160; From the northeast in winter.<br>
&#160; From the southwest in summer.<br>
<br>
&#160; There can be practically no
rainfall in the Indus Valley in
winter because the winds blow over
the great land mass of eastern and
south-central Asia before reaching
the Indus and have lost their
moisture.<br>
&#160; There is more rainfall in summer
because the winds from the southwest
come directly from the
ocean. The valley lies so low,
however, that the winds sweep
over the southern part of it without
having much of their moisture
condensed. There is little
condensation until they near the
highlands on the north.<br>
&#160; Refer to rainfall maps which
show well-watered regions in the
upper valley—desert in the lower.<br>
&#160; Generally favorable in the upper
valley—unfavorable in the lower.<br>
<br><br><br><br>

&#160; The Nile Valley—Egypt.<br>
<br><br>

&#160; The annual overflow of the
river.<br>
&#160; The heavy precipitation in the
mountainous districts that feed its
tributaries.<br>
<br>
&#160; Indus has many tributaries that
rise in the Himalayas. In the
summer, when the snows on the
mountains melt, these tributaries
carry to the main stream such a
quantity of water that an inundation
results.<br>
    </div>

    <div class="textcol">
&#160; Find out whether your conclusions
are right.<br>
<br><br><br>
&#160; Is the temperature of Florida
favorable or unfavorable to crops?<br>
&#160; Is a temperature somewhat
hotter in summer and colder in
winter unfavorable to crops?<br>
&#160; Is there anything, then, in the
temperature of the Indus Valley
that explains their famines?<br>
&#160; We must evidently look for
some other cause for the famines.
Upon what other climatic conditions
do crops depend?<br>
&#160; In what wind belt does the
Indus Valley lie?<br>
&#160; From what general direction
do the trades blow in the northern
hemisphere?<br>
&#160; Let us see if there is ever any
exception to this rule. How does
the temperature of the land
compare with the temperature of
the water in summer? What effect
has this upon the air over the
land? What naturally follows?<br>
<br>   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
&#160; From what direction, then, do
the winds blow in India?<br>
&#160; Turn to the map of the winds
and find the exact direction. These
winds are called the <em>Southwest
Monsoons.</em><br>
<br>
&#160; Tell again from what direction
the winds of India come.<br>
<br>
&#160; What, then, do you conclude as
to the rainfall of the Indus Valley
in winter? Is there apt to be more
or less rainfall in summer? Why?
Look at the map very carefully
and see if it is likely that even
the summer winds bring much
rainfall. Is the rainfall equally
light all through the valley? Where
is it apt to be heaviest? Why?<br>
<br><br><br><br>
&#160; Prove that your conclusions
are correct.<br>
<br><br>
&#160; Would you then say that the
rainfall is favorable or
unfavorable for agriculture?<br>
&#160; Does this mean, necessarily,
that agriculture cannot be carried
on in the lower valley?<br>
&#160; What other river valley have
you studied that is noted for its
agriculture in spite of a very
light rainfall?<br>
&#160; What makes agriculture possible
in the Nile Valley?<br>
&#160; To what is the overflow of the
Nile due?<br>
<br>
&#160; Is there anything in the location
of the Indus that makes it
likely that it, too, overflows?

    <div class="textcol">
&#160; Overflow is less and a
correspondingly smaller area
productive.<br>
<br>
&#160; Character of the soil.<br>
<br><br><br>

&#160; River valleys in general have a
rich soil. A river that overflows
leaves a deposit of rich mud that
makes its banks very fertile.<br>
<br>
&#160; Favorable—warm climate, rich
soil, overflow of the river.<br>
&#160; Unfavorable—scanty rainfall.<br>
<br>
&#160; Crops grow so rapidly and easily
when rains do not fail, that vast
numbers of the people engage in
farming. It is almost purely an
agricultural region.<br>
<br>
&#160; It has attracted vast numbers of
people.<br>
<br>
&#160; Principal products—millet,
rice, cotton, sugar cane, wheat,
tea.<br>
<br><br>
&#160; Practically all needed for home
consumption.<br>
<br><br>
&#160; More railroads might be built
in order that food products could
be carried readily from one section
to another.<br>
<br>
&#160; Better methods of irrigation
might be employed.<br>
<br>
&#160; More variety of occupation
might be introduced, so that fewer
people would be directly dependent
upon agriculture for a living.<br>

productiveness of a region depend?<br>

&#160; Can you come to any conclusion
in regard to the soil of the Indus
Valley?<br>
<br><br>
&#160; State again the conditions in
the valley that are favorable to

<h3>A LESSON FOR APPRECIATION</h3>

<p>A lesson for appreciation which includes creative and interpretative
work. The interpretation of the song in the dance,
or dramatic game.</p>

<p>This lesson was planned and taught to a group of second-grade
children by Miss Eleanor Wright of the Speyer School,
Teachers College, Columbia University.</p>

<p>The lesson was based upon the little German folk song which
<span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<p class="smcap">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Method of Procedure</p>
<p>I. <em>A.</em> 1. Do you remember, children,
that I promised
you a great surprise this
morning? Well, this is it.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; 2. One day, not long ago,
Miss S., Miss T., and I
were talking over our
program for the May
Festival, and we decided
that the little people did
not have enough to do.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The first-grade children
are to play a little story,
and our two grades, you
know, are to sing <cite>The
Little Princess</cite>—so we
thought that the second
grade ought to have
a little part of its own.
Now what do you think
it is to be? I am going
to tell you.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; 3. We are going to make
our own little dance to
the music of <i lang="de">Das Pferdchen</i>.
Don’t you think
that will be very interesting?</p>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1. When we made the
tunes for our songs last
winter, what did the
music always have to tell?</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Just so, as we make
our dance to-day, it must
tell the same story as the
folk song.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. Let us sing one of our
little songs that we have
known for a long time,
and see if we can tell,
in a dance, how that
makes us feel.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Different children
may here give different,
individual interpretations.
Encourage much
freedom.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I am thinking of another
tune that is quite
different from this one.
You may sing it with
me if you like.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Virginia may show us
how that song makes
her feel: what she wishes
to do when she hears it.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (Handle these two
songs in a manner similar
     to that used for the
     other two.)</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I am going to choose
James to dance this, for
he knows so much about
soldiers.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Whom do you think
    could best show us how
<em>Bye-Low</em> “goes”? Yes,
I believe the girls can.</p>

very carefully so that
you can tell what <em>this</em>
little horse does.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 4. Is this stanza alike

<h3>A LESSON IN ARITHMETIC BASED ON A REAL PROBLEM WHICH
WAS INTERESTING TO CHILDREN</h3>

<p>Such a lesson gives little opportunity for practice in arithmetical
computation, but gives the very best possible motive
for the drill work which is to follow. This lesson was planned
and taught in the third grade of the Speyer School, Teachers
College, Columbia University, by Miss Roxana A. Steele.</p>

value of itemized bills.</p>

<p>To make children conscious of their need for the multiplication

given to a poor family on Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p>We cannot always follow in every detail the plan which
we make for a lesson. It is interesting in this connection to
read Miss Steele’s accurate account of what actually happened
when the lesson, as planned above, was taught. The
description which follows appeared in the <cite>Atlantic Educational
Journal</cite> for November, 1910.</p>


<p class="p2 pfs90">A PRACTICAL LESSON IN ARITHMETIC</p>

<p class="pfs80 smcap">By Roxana A. Steele, Speyer School, Teachers College,
Columbia University</p>

<div class="p2 blockquotx">

<p><em>Pupil’s aim:</em> To find the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

<p><em>Teacher’s aim:</em> To make children conscious of their needs in arithmetic.</p>

<p>Last fall Grade Three had been studying the wholesale market in
industrial work. The wholesale market was compared with the retail
market, prices contrasted, etc., and much language and arithmetic work
was based upon this work.</p>

<p>A few days before Thanksgiving a gentleman stepped into the school
office and offered to pay for one of the Thanksgiving baskets which the
school sends out to poor families in the neighborhood. No one seemed
to know the exact value of one of the baskets, so Grade Three was asked
to make the estimate.</p>

<p>This could have been done by an adult in a few minutes, but it would
have been done no more accurately than the children were able to do it
after having made a careful study of market lists. The exercise also
furnished an excellent child’s aim for the arithmetic lesson. The class
felt its responsibility and was anxious to do good work.</p>

<p>The list of things generally put into one of the baskets was given to
the class. The children decided upon the <em>average</em> price of each item.
This called for an appreciation of the word <em>average</em>. The work was
done orally with class discussion. For instance, when the price of a
squash was asked, one child said “twelve cents,” another, “eighteen
cents,” etc. The class finally agreed that a medium-sized squash would
cost about fifteen cents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<table class="autotable fs85">
<tr>
<td class="tdl wd80">Small squash</td>
<td class="tdr ">12¢</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Large squash</td>
<td class="tdr">18¢</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td class="tdr bt">2 ) 30¢</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td class="tdr bt">15¢</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The child who recorded the price of the squash on the board wrote
fifteen cents—$.15. Before the lesson was over, several children had
a little trouble in writing cents without dimes ($.06), keeping the money
columns straight, using the dollar mark and decimal point, etc. With
suggestions from other members of the class, the list was complete.</p>

<p>In the item “6 lb. of beef @ 16¢” the class found that it was necessary
to multiply by six. As they had never had the six table, I did not
expect them to be able to do it, but it chanced that one boy knew his
six table and did the work readily.</p>

<p>When the price of each item had been decided upon, the children
found the total cost at their seats, and their results were compared.</p>

<p>The lesson closed with the question, “What did you find out in to-day’s
lesson?” The answers were: “The cost of a Thanksgiving basket”;
“That Russell is the only child who knows his six table”; “That we
need to write dollars and cents so that we won’t make mistakes.”</p>

<p>At the beginning of the arithmetic lesson the following day, when
the class was asked, “What do we need to do to-day?” there was a division
of opinion as to whether the drill on dollars and cents or learning
of the six table should come first. The decision was in favor of the drill
on writing money, and the six table was presented later in the same
period.</p>

<p>The result of the lesson on the cost of the dinner was sent to the principal.
The class received a note of thanks for the help which it had
rendered. The children were proud of their accomplishment and anxious
to work out more real problems.</p>

<h3>A LESSON FOR APPRECIATION</h3>

<p><em>Teacher’s aim:</em> To help children to enjoy Stevenson’s
<cite>Bed in Summer</cite>.</p>

<p>Did any child in the room ever have to go to bed before it
was dark? Did you ever get up in the morning before daylight?
Stevenson remembered how he used to feel when he
had to go to bed before dark, and wrote a story about it. Would
you like to hear the story?</p>

<p><em>Children’s aim:</em> To enjoy Stevenson’s story about going
to bed before dark.</p>

    <div class="textcol">
<p class="smcap">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Subject Matter</p>
<br>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <span class="fs80">BED IN SUMMER</span><br>
<br>
“In winter I get up at night<br>
&#160; And dress by yellow candle light;<br>
&#160; In summer quite the other way,<br>
&#160; I have to go to bed by day.<br>
<br>
“I have to go to bed and see<br>
&#160; The birds still hopping on the tree,<br>
&#160; And hear the grown-up people’s feet<br>
&#160; Still going past me in the street.<br>
<br>
“And does it not seem hard to you,<br>
&#160; When all the sky is clear and blue,<br>
&#160; And I should like so much to play,<br>
&#160; To have to go to bed by day?”<br>
    </div>

    <div class="textcol">
<p class="smcap">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Method of Procedure</p>
<br>
&#160; I want you to tell me all you
can about the place where Stevenson
lived, when I am through reading
the story.<br>
&#160; Read the poem.<br>
&#160; Who will describe the place
where he lived?<br>
&#160; Were there other children who
lived near by?<br>
&#160; Were there any trees near the
house?<br>
&#160; I’ll read the poem again and you
will see how many reasons Stevenson
had for not wanting to go to
bed by day.<br>
&#160; Read the poem again twice.<br>
&#160; Why does he tell you that he has
to get up at night in the winter?<br>
&#160; When do the birds go to bed?<br>
&#160; Do the grown-up people go to
bed when children do?<br>
&#160; How was he able to see the birds
in the trees? Do you think he
ever got out of bed?<br>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
&#160; Do you think all the children in
the street had to go to bed as
early as Stevenson? Let me read
the last stanza and see whether
you can tell.<br>
&#160; Recall the Mother Goose Rhyme:<br>
“Girls and boys come out to play,<br>
&#160; The moon doth shine as bright
as day;<br>
&#160; Leave your supper and leave
your sleep,<br>
&#160; And come with your playfellows
into the street.”<br>
<br>
&#160; How did Stevenson know the
other children were in the street?<br>
&#160; Read the last stanza.<br>
&#160; I’ll read the whole story again,
and then ask some one to tell me
Stevenson’s story about going to
bed in summer.<br>
&#160; Read the poem, calling attention
to the different scenes: (1) The
boy that gets up by night and
dresses by yellow candle-light.
(2) In summer quite the other way,
he has to go to bed by day—he
has to go to bed and see the birds
still hopping on the tree and hear
the grown-up people’s feet still
going past him in the street. (3)
The little boy lying in bed who
feels very much abused.<br>
&#160; And does it not seem hard to you,
etc.? Let us see all of the
pictures again. Read in same way
again. Who will tell the story?
&#160; I am going to write it on the
board, so that we can tell the
story as Stevenson did.<br>
    </div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>After the treatment indicated above, memorization will be
very easily accomplished. The preliminary study for appreciation
will make the poem mean more to the children than it
could have meant had the teacher simply read it to the children
two or three times and then asked them to memorize it.</p>

<p>In a study lesson, the plans will vary from a single exercise
in finding the principal thought in a paragraph to a development
lesson, not dissimilar as to plan to other lessons of the
same type. The recitation lesson may be a development
lesson, inductive or deductive, or a drill lesson. The plans
would therefore be similar to those given above.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be suggested that any teacher who feels
that it is impossible to plan all of her work will gain greatly if
she will plan carefully for a single subject. As facility is gained
in plan making, it will be possible to write plans for two or
three or for more subjects. A topic plan should result in definiteness
in the work of both teacher and pupils. Good plans
give the teacher more freedom in conducting her work, and
enable her to tell definitely the progress which the class has
made. Plans are necessary in teaching. No one has a right
to pretend to teach without previous thought concerning the
subject to be taught, and the method to be employed in giving
children command of this material.</p>

<p class="p1 noindent"><em>Exercises.</em></p>

<p>The plans which follow were offered to teachers as suggestions rather
than as outlines of subject matter or of procedure to be followed absolutely.
Reorganize these plans so as to show subject matter and method
separately. Add to the subject matter or method wherever necessary.
If you think best, change the organization of material, the statement of
aim, the references to books, and the like. Do not change the topic.
As a result of your work you should be ready to present a plan for which
you are willing to stand.</p>

<p>By showing the picture in the book, have the children solve the problem.</p>

<p>Did Atalanta expect to win the race? Why not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>How did this make her act?</p>

<p>Did the hare expect to lose the race? Why not?</p>

<p>The teacher may tell the story of the girl going to market with a
basket of eggs on her head. She was so sure of getting
sale for her eggs that she set to dreaming of the pretty
things she would buy with the money she was to get for
the eggs. She would buy, she thought, a bright new
dress and a new hat; and then how mean and shabby
she could make the other girls look; and how she could
walk past them all, tossing her head in pride! Forgetting
that she was still only on her way to market, she
then gave her head a proud little toss; and—what do
you think happened?</p>

<p>Let the children give the story of the Hare and the Tortoise in their
own words.</p>

<p>What is likely to happen to any one of us who is too sure of winning?</p>

<p>What will we say, then, of any one who is too sure of anything?</p>

<p>It has been said, “Count not your chickens before they are hatched.”
What does this mean?</p>

of vehicles; printed matter issued by the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and by the Department
of Agriculture.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="nowrap">Aim:—</span></p>

<div class="hang6">
<p>To train the children to meet sympathetically and intelligently their
responsibilities to the horse.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="nowrap">Preparation:—</span></p>

<div class="hang6">
<p>Years of interest in horses; directed observation of other periods.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="nowrap">Presentation:—</span></p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>1. Stories of horses known to the children—those owned by
their parents, fire horses, horses of the mounted police,
showing their faithfulness, intelligence, strength, training,
treatment.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; In the city of Baltimore the old fire horse is practically pensioned
when unfit for further service. This is one way
in which right-minded people acknowledge their obligations
to horses, by providing for their comfort in their
old age.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Have stories like the <cite>Pacing Mustang</cite> read to the class;
allow the children to take the storybooks home, and
encourage them to bring to the class other stories about
horses. Encourage the children to read brief histories
of the great breeds of horses—the Norman horses,
Clydesdales, etc.—horses that hold the world’s records
for speed.</p>

<p>2. Observations to identify horses that show normal blood, and
discover their fitness of blood and temperament for the
work they are doing.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Are they strong enough for the work they are required to do?</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Are they disturbed by passing street cars? If so, how do they
show it?</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; What is the effect upon them of the confusion of other city
noises?</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Notice that while some horses are evidently distressed by the
confusion of city life, others love it and become homesick
when sold for use in the country.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="nowrap">Blanketing:—</span></p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; Call attention to the manner in which large firms so carefully
blanket their horses.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Why should a horse be blanketed when he is standing?</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="nowrap">Shoeing:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; Notice the cause of slipping, stumbling, and falling on icy or
wet pavements, and therefore the necessity for rough
shoes, rubber shoes, etc.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; If possible, bring into the class a specimen of a patent horseshoe;
the shoe and shield of a cart horse.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="nowrap">Harness:—</span></p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; Is the horse easy in harness?</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; What sort of a checkrein would you use? Why?</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Why is the back pad used with the two-wheel cart?</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; What are the effects of an ill-fitting harness?</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; What do you think of the law which in some places punishes a
man whose horses show galls?</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="nowrap">Horsemanship:—</span></p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; Have the children report critical situations which have happened
within their observation and how they were met
by drivers; their observation of the affection shown by
a horse toward his master.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">General Condition of <span class="nowrap">Horses:—</span></p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; Discuss the effect of grooming upon the horse’s coat.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Why should the horse be fed regularly?</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Why should ground food be given to an old horse whose teeth
are poor?</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Discuss the necessity of allowing the horse freedom in traveling.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Temporary lameness is frequently due to a stone in the foot;
how may it be removed?</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; What should be done for a horse that is seriously lame?</p>

<p>3. The economic value of such knowledge as the <span class="nowrap">foregoing:—</span></p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Horses are stiffened by standing unblanketed in the wind or
cold.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Foundering is caused by watering a horse when he is over-heated.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; A properly fitted harness and a comfortable checkrein, if any
is used, save the strength of the horse.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; The selection of a horse whose strength and temperament fit
him for his work adds to his value and usefulness.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Skillful drivers, especially those who like their teams, can secure
a great amount of work from them and yet save much
of their energy. It frequently happens that after a day’s
work one man will bring in a team comparatively fresh,
while under a different driver the same team will be
worried into exhaustion.</p>

<p>4. Knowledge of the work of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to <span class="nowrap">Animals:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>&#160; &#160; The work of this society demands judgment based on a fuller
knowledge of conditions and causes than most children
of their ages possess. Its work, therefore, is not intended
for children, but they should know what help
they may give the society, and be taught to use it.</p>

<p>5. Knowledge of the city law for protecting horses.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Seat <span class="nowrap">Work:—</span></p>

<div class="hang6">

<p>Sketches of horses’ hoofs showing how a stone may cause lameness.</p>

<p>Sketches of different kinds of shoes.</p>

<p>Sketches of different kinds of checkreins: the overdraw check and
its effect; side check and its effect.</p>

<p>Different head and ear postures of horses indicative of their conditions
and feelings.</p>

<p>Getting records of observations into shape to present to class.</p>

<p>Have each member of the class imagine himself to be his favorite horse,—a
fire horse; mounted policeman’s horse; a United
Railway repair wagon horse; a hospital ambulance horse;
an express-wagon horse; a carriage horse; a broken-down
carriage horse, etc.,—and write a story of his part in a
fire, a serious accident, or some other situation.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE TEACHER IN RELATION TO SUPERVISION</span></h2>


<p>Teachers are generally responsible in some measure to one
or more supervisory officers. Those who control the schools
believe that better work will be done because of the supervision
which is provided. It may not be out of place, therefore, in a
book devoted to the problems of the teacher to consider the
relation to supervision and to those who supervise her work.</p>

<p>The fundamental purpose of supervision, whether of schools
or of other activities, is increased efficiency of all who participate
in the work. Supervisors are worthy of the name only
when they do their best to increase the efficiency of every teacher
with whom they come in contact. Happily, this attitude of
helpfulness characterizes most of those who are known as principals,
primary or grammar-grade supervisors, subject supervisors,
assistant and associate superintendents, and superintendents
of schools. It may be that because of the great
number of teachers employed in a system of schools some of
these officers can have little direct relationship with individual
teachers; but in the organization of the schools, by means of
regulations, courses of study and the like, or through those
who come directly in contact with teachers, these men and
women seek to help each teacher to do better work. It is
important that all teachers realize clearly the significance of
the supervisor’s work, and that she avail herself of the help
and coöperation which is thus provided.</p>

<p>One of the functions of the supervisor is to criticize the work
which is being done by individual teachers. It is especially
difficult for some teachers to appreciate the purpose of such
criticism, or to avail themselves of the aid which is offered in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
this form. Let us examine the different kinds of criticism
which one may expect to receive, and try to discover how to
get the most out of this instrument of supervision.</p>

<p>There are supervisors whose criticism is occasionally purely
negative. They come into the room, observe some of the
work, and remark, either at the time or later, that the work was
good, or that it was poor. It does not help one much, except
in a feeling of good will toward the supervisor, when told that
work is well done; nor is it very significant for future work
that one’s efforts have been condemned. When the supervisor
indulges in this type of criticism, the teacher has a right to ask
him for the reasons which lead him to praise or to condemn.
If excellent work is to be repeated, then the elements which
have made for success should be pointed out. One may try
to repeat good work and fail miserably because the elements
in the excellent work which made for success have been overlooked
in the second effort. Likewise failure may occur, even
though it has been stamped as poor work, because the teacher
fails to see the essential weakness of her effort.</p>

<p>Most supervisors are able to find strength of some sort in
the work of every teacher. It may be worth while for the
teacher at times to ask for a discussion of the strong points in
her work. This constructive appreciative criticism may help
her to receive with open mind the destructive criticism which
may be needed to bring about the elimination of weakness.
Any teacher should welcome the criticism which frankly points
out the deficiencies of her work and suggests the remedies
which should be applied. We all want to do our best work.
Unfortunately we cannot always see our teaching in true perspective.
The supervisor who comes in from the outside, as it
were, with a wide range of experience in teaching and in observing
teachers can often give the suggestion which will make
work, not only more efficient, but also more pleasant.</p>

<p>It is a good rule for both supervisor and teacher to wait
until the end of the day or even for two or three days after the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
visit before the criticism is given. Snap judgments are apt to
be wrong on both sides. The supervisor needs time to analyze
the situation carefully in order to pick out the elements in the
situation which are most significant and to overlook that which
is trivial. The teacher will often be able to analyze her own
work and to point out its defects, if time is given her to think it
over. If the teacher can discover her own inefficiency, and
if she is willing to talk frankly with the supervisor concerning
these difficulties, the work of criticism will give satisfaction to
both. A teacher has a right to ask for an appointment with
a supervisor for the discussion of her work. Supervisors are,
as a rule, only too willing to grant such a request.</p>

<p>Criticism has not fulfilled its mission, if it stops with discovering
to the teacher her strength and her weakness together
with the analysis of the situation which enables her to repeat
successes and avoid failures. A wide-awake teacher will be
looking and asking for suggestions concerning new kinds of
work. Suggestive criticism opens up the way for growth by
giving the teacher the encouragement and help which are
needed to undertake the new or unusual type of work. Many
of the best teachers might have remained in the less efficient
group, had it not been for the help and inspiration which was
imparted by a wise supervisor.</p>

<p>School exhibits are another means sometimes employed by
the supervisory force to increase school efficiency. Here, again,
the teacher should realize that the purpose of the supervisor is
not to burden her with work, but rather to offer the help
which may come from an exchange of experiences. The
school exhibit which is most worth while does not require
any special preparation of material on the part of the teacher.
The work regularly done by children without corrections or
refinement constitutes a true exhibit of the results secured.
Any other kind of an exhibit is merely a test of the teacher’s
ingenuity, her skill in masquerading under the names of her
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>When a genuine exhibit of children’s work is brought together,
it affords to teachers and supervisors alike a wealth of
suggestion and help. The writer remembers visiting an exhibit
of drawing and constructive work in one of our large
cities. The supervisors of this work were in charge at regular
hours each week. A very large number of teachers came to
see what was being done by other teachers in their grade. A
special feature of the exhibit was an abundance of suggestions
for the work of the next week provided by the supervisors and
taken from the work of previous years. The consultation
between supervisors and teachers concerning the work exhibited,
and with reference to the work both past and yet to be
done, was free from restraint and often lasted ten, fifteen, or
even twenty minutes. Needless to say, the results achieved in
drawing and constructive work in this city were far above the
average. Similar exhibits of work in English composition,
arithmetic, some phases of the work in literature, nature study,
history, and geography are possible and cannot fail to help the
teacher who is anxious to improve her work.</p>

<p>Visiting the work of other teachers has one advantage not
possessed by the exhibit: it is possible to see not only the result
but also the methods which are employed in securing the
product. A good supervisor should be able to tell teachers
where to go to see the kind of work which is most helpful.
Any teacher should welcome the opportunity to see the work
of a teacher who is strong where she is weak. Random visiting
is not worth much. What counts is a visit to a teacher
who has some help to offer, in order to satisfy a real need.
Often the most profitable visiting can be done within the system
in which the teacher works. Not infrequently the greatest
help can be secured from another teacher in the same building.
Whenever or wherever a teacher visits, the important thing is
to look for the strong points in the work. The teacher who
goes for help will not be disappointed; the one who looks for
defects, who is hypercritical, will not profit by the time used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>After a visit to a teacher whose work is known by the supervisor,
a conference may be held, or a report given by the visiting
teacher. If the visit is worth making, it is worth some
further consideration. It will help the teacher to talk over
the visit with the supervisor with particular reference to her
own work. The elements of strength in the work of the
teacher visited can thus be determined, and the modifications
in the work of the visitor desired by the supervisor be made
definite.</p>

<p>Examinations have from time immemorial been used by
supervisors to determine the success of school work. Teachers
not infrequently seem to feel that they are an unnecessary
hardship imposed without sufficient justification, whether
teacher or pupils are considered. Let us inquire what examinations
should mean to the teacher. First of all, it may be worth
while to remember that the command of some knowledge, and
the ability to use it when demanded, should form a part of the
equipment of children who are being educated. It is well at
times to stop and discover how much children know, and what
facility they show in using their knowledge. It is a shock
sometimes to discover that a room full of enthusiastic, well-behaved
children do not know their multiplication tables,
cannot add, subtract, or divide without making many mistakes,
cannot write an acceptable paragraph because of mistakes
in form which they should have mastered long ago, do
not know on which side of the Ohio River to locate the state of
Ohio; but that is just what is apt to happen in a school where
examinations are never given.</p>

<p>Success or failure in an examination should not be all-important
to children, nor should it lead to undue praise or condemnation
of teachers. The wise teacher will try to find in the
results of the examination evidence of the deficiencies of her
teaching. In the light of the work done by the children she
can tell where she can depend upon their knowledge, what part
of the work needs to be reviewed, which children need special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
help. An examination should be a taking of stock which will
enable teacher and pupil to do more and better work, because
each is acquainted with the needs of the situation better than
before.</p>

<p>Teachers’ meetings are worth just about what each individual
teacher is willing to put into them. The teacher who
comes to a meeting with her problems, willing to acknowledge
that she needs help, and anxious to get it will not find these
gatherings dull or uninteresting. If the meeting is organized
for study, as is done in connection with reading circle work, the
meeting can be transformed from a perfunctory recitation of
the ideas of the book into a live professional discussion, by
the activity of two or three earnest teachers. If the meetings
are not good, individuals are at fault; if these teachers become
active, if they try to make the most out of these discussions,
their attitude will change.</p>

<p>One of the best types of teachers’ meetings is centered round
the actual teaching of children by a member of the group, to be
followed by discussion of the work done. There is no more
certain way to grow professionally than to be willing to demonstrate
your theory by practice, or to discuss the work which is
done by other members of the group. In several of our cities
these lessons, taught sometimes by the supervisors and at other
times by the teachers themselves, have become a regular feature
of the year’s work. The teacher who is most anxious to
grow will be the first to avail herself of the opportunity to
teach such a lesson. Supervisors sometimes hesitate to suggest
this kind of a program for teachers’ meetings, because teachers
are so unwilling to do their part in making the work a success.
It is a poor professional spirit which is not strong enough to
lead a teacher to accept the criticism of her fellow teachers,
when she knows that therein lies the possibility of growth.
Any group of teachers who will voluntarily participate in such
work will find that the teachers’ meeting, instead of being a
bore, will come to be looked upon as the brightest spot in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
whole week, because of the help and inspiration which is derived
from the hour’s work.</p>

<p>Institutes were once looked upon as places where teachers
came to be entertained, or, possibly, to be inspired. There
was a time when the best institutes were conducted on the
“pouring in” plan. A lecturer, or several lecturers, dispensed
the truth, and teachers sat in their places, supposedly drinking
deep draughts from these fountains of wisdom. It is strange
that all of the theory of teaching which was dispensed did not
suggest that the manner of conducting the institute was wrong.
In our best institutes to-day teachers participate in discussion,
study and recite from books, undertake the revision or
organization of courses of study in coöperation with their
supervisors; in short, the institute has become a school for
professional study. In such an institute, as in teachers’ meetings,
those who come with real problems, anxious to get help,
find the week or two all too short. A group of teachers anxious
to grow professionally can, in most cases, secure the coöperation
of supervisors in transforming an institute which is organized
on the old basis.</p>

<p>If a teacher’s supervisors are not helping her, it may be well
to inquire whose fault it is. The teacher who meets the supervisor
halfway, the one who invites criticism, who avails herself
of the help and suggestion which may come from exhibits,
visiting, teachers’ meetings, and institutes will, in all probability,
grow strong enough to help others. She may in her turn
be called upon to accept the responsibilities, the trials, and the
joys of a supervisor.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<span class="fs80">THE TEACHER IN RELATION TO THE COURSE OF STUDY</span></h2>


<p>Teachers sometimes look upon the course of study merely
as a demand made by those in control of the school system for
a large amount of work to be accomplished. The course of
study indicates that certain topics in English, arithmetic,
nature study, geography, history, industrial arts, and the other
subjects of the curriculum are assigned to the grade, and the
teacher expects that her pupils will be examined on this work
at stated times during the year in order to determine the efficiency
of her work and the fitness of the children for promotion.
From this point of view, the course of study is an ever present
taskmaster, always urging that more work be accomplished.
Let us inquire whether this is in reality the meaning of the
course of study to the teacher.</p>

<p>In the first place, all will admit that in any system of schools
it is necessary to determine somewhat definitely the work to
be done by a given grade. If such provision were not made,
it would be impossible to transfer children from one school to
another, and very difficult for the supervisory force to render
help to large numbers of teachers. Then, too, there is an order
in the development of subjects, which is necessary both from
the standpoint of the subject and from the point of view of the
child who is to gain the experience which the subject offers.</p>

<p>It is true that a course of study which is made to fit all of
the children of a great city or state must be interpreted liberally,
if good teaching is to be done. To this end, our best
courses of study demand that a minimum amount of work be
done by all teachers, and suggest alternative and optional work
to meet the needs of children whose experiences are varied,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
and whose needs are correspondingly different. In any progressive
school system, the capable teacher has opportunity
to vary the material presented under the head of the various
subjects in such a manner as will satisfy the interests and the
problems of the group of children for whose growth she is
responsible.</p>

<p>A good course of study will save the teacher much time and
energy by the organization of material which it presents. In
many of our larger cities a volume of from fifty to two hundred
pages has been prepared for each subject. These manuals
suggest the order in which it has been found by experience that
the topics can best be presented. In many cases a helpful
analysis of each large topic from the point of view of presenting
it to children is included. Besides this organization of material,
references which will prove helpful to the teacher, both from
the standpoint of subject matter and of method, are included
in our best courses of study. In many cases suggestions for
teaching, elaborated at times into complete lesson plans, are
given.</p>

<p>In the making of the course of study, the teacher should
welcome any opportunity to contribute her knowledge concerning
the availability of material or the methods to be used
in her grade. Any good course of study should be the joint
product of at least three classes of people: the expert in the
subject, the expert in supervision and administration of schools,
and the expert teacher. The subject matter expert is needed
to pass upon the material from the standpoint of fact and from
the point of view of one who sees the beginnings of a subject
in relation to the whole field. The supervisor has to provide
for the proper relation of the different subjects, determines the
amount of time to be devoted to the subject, and the general
method of procedure in teaching the subject. The teacher
needs to advise as to the practicability of the whole scheme.
She has in mind a particular group of children with certain
experiences, interests, and abilities, and her judgment is probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
safer than either of the others as to the availability of any
particular topic or phase of the subject. In addition to this
service, any group of teachers can give most significant help
with respect to the methods which have proved most helpful.
Indeed, our courses of study could be made much more helpful
if teachers were only asked to give suggestions concerning
the organization of material and methods of teaching, which
they are so well equipped to offer by reason of their experience
in teaching the subject to children. Happily, the practice of
inviting the coöperation of teachers in making the course of
study is becoming more common in our cities. Any capable
teacher who is anxious to participate in the organization of the
curriculum will find opportunity to make her contribution.</p>

<p>Possibly there are teachers who, because of the very excellence
of the courses of study provided, feel that all that is required
for them is to follow blindly the directions given. Instead
of considering the course of study as a hard taskmaster,
they look upon it as a crutch upon which they lean heavily.
For these teachers there is little need for preparation. The
course of study and the textbooks have solved the problems of
teaching. Let us inquire just what the curriculum of our
schools stands for before attempting to decide just what relation
the teacher bears to it.</p>

<p>A course of study is not so much knowledge to be poured in.
Rather it represents possible experiences for which children
may have need, experiences which will aid them in the solution
of their problems and make possible for them the realization
of their purposes. How did all of this knowledge come to
be preserved, and how did it happen to be arranged in groups
labeled by certain names? Men have preserved from time
to time, by handing down by word of mouth or by records
made on stone, wood, skin, paper, or other surfaces, knowledge
which they have found useful in meeting the problems which
confront them. For convenience of reference this knowledge
has come to be grouped, and to each group a name has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
applied. If we could only remember how we came to have this
body of knowledge, how it happened to be thought worth while
to preserve the experiences which when grouped together we
know as subjects, it might make us a little more judicious in
our attempt to acquaint children with their inheritance.</p>

<p>Our schools have all too frequently acted upon the principle
that children could assimilate the school subjects without
reference to their past experience or their present needs. It has
been common to say, teach so much of this or that subject,
just as if the child mind was a receptacle to be filled. The
difficulty of this attitude toward school subjects is twofold:
first, the children fail to gain any appreciation of the experiences
involved; and, second, they fail to gain from the process
the power of independent thought, or the spirit of investigation
which it is the purpose of education to impart.</p>

<p>The doctrine of formal discipline, as commonly interpreted,
has been largely responsible for our wrong idea of the meaning
of subjects of study. The idea that any study, especially if it
proved disagreeable to the pupil, and had no definite relationship
either to his past experiences or present needs, would
mean most for his education, has not yet entirely disappeared.
Aside from the psychological fallacy involved, that ability
to do one kind of work would spread or be available for all
other kinds of mental activity which we call by the same general
name, the devotees of the doctrine ignored the fact that
the maximum of activity or hard mental work could be secured
only under the stimulus of genuine interest.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Possibly the introduction of the industrial arts<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and the
more rational approach which they demand, may serve to
illustrate the method to be used in teaching other subjects.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
In cooking, for example, we would hardly expect to have a
child begin by engaging in an exercise in beating eggs without
reference to any problem which required this activity. If children
are to learn something of wood and its use in our industries,
we commonly expect them to gain some knowledge
of the processes involved in the course of the construction of
furniture for the playhouse, a flower box for the window, a sled,
a checkerboard, or some other interesting project. It is true
that the industrial arts lend themselves more readily to the
dominant interests of children to do and to make than do most
school subjects. If these activities, which are essentially the
activities characteristic of our modern civilization, be used to
best advantage, they will offer many opportunities for making
significant the other subjects.</p>

<p>Any considerable participation in the processes which are
fundamental to the great industries cannot fail to arouse an
interest in the source of materials, the development of the industry,
and a desire to express one’s self with reference to the
work which is being done. From the interest in the source of
materials grows naturally the work in nature study and geography.
The development of the industry takes us back even
to the time of primitive man, and history becomes significant.
The handling of materials in construction suggests the need of
measurement, and arithmetic is provided for. In all of this
work there will be a demand for communication, the necessity
to learn what others have recorded in books, and the wish to
express one’s own experience in oral and written speech. The
experiences of people like ourselves, as idealized in literature,
will make its appeal in spite of the worst our teaching can do.
It is not maintained that all subject matter groups itself naturally
around industrial activities, and that these activities
should, therefore, form the center of the curriculum; rather, it
is sought to emphasize the relationships to the real needs of
children and the possibility of utilizing these 
<ins class="corr" id="tn-236" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'genuine motive'">
genuine motives</ins> in the teaching of school subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p>We teach the subjects of the curriculum in order that children
may understand their environment, be adjusted to it, and,
as President Butler puts it, come into possession of their spiritual
inheritance. Out of the work which is done, these same
children should gain power to adapt themselves to new conditions
and should be equipped to render service in the progress
which is yet to be made in our society. Now one’s
adjustment to the present environment must be an adjustment
to <em>his</em> environment, a solution of his problems as they at present
exist. Future adaptability is conditioned by the experience
which one has had in making such adjustments.
The ability to contribute to the progress in which each should
participate is dependent, not so much upon the number of facts
one possesses, as upon the attitude of investigation which
characterizes him, the respect for truth, and ability to think
straight which have been developed by his education. From
whatever point of view we approach the problem of teaching
our subjects, the answer is the same: meet present situations,
solve present real, vital problems, make subject
matter meet the needs of the children you are teaching.
This analysis of the curriculum makes apparent the important
part to be played by the teacher in making available
the experiences which the school subjects are organized to
present.</p>

<p>The courses of study may present much that is helpful in
the organization of material, the suggestions for teaching may
be gathered from the experience of many teachers, and still
the great problem of making these subjects vital to children
remains as the work of every teacher. Motives which grow
out of the experience which children have already had must
be sought. The material to be presented will be significant
in the experience of these children only when they approach
it in order to satisfy their real needs. Aside from the possibility
of finding in one of the subjects, as, for example, the industrial
arts, a motive for other work, the school situation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
itself presents many opportunities for discovering real needs
to children.</p>

<p>The school festival, school parties for parents, fairs and
sales, the general assembly, excursions, gardening or other
industrial activity, plays and games, have in the hands of
skillful teachers provided a compelling motive for a great
variety of school work. The author would not deny the power
of intellectual interest, but he knows, as does every other teacher,
that with children in the elementary school this motive is only
gradually developed. The teacher who is alert to find some
real need for the computations of arithmetic; who gives a
genuine opportunity for oral or written expression; who appeals
to the desire to use the knowledge gained in history and
geography by means of the historical festival, the article in the
school paper, and the like, as well as to the curiosity of the child;
who allows children to make real things which satisfy their
individual or collective needs in the industrial arts,—is the
teacher who is teaching school subjects in the way that will
mean most in the education of her pupils.</p>

<p>The demand that the teacher vitalize the curriculum does
not lose sight of the necessity for drill, or of the demand that
children <em>know</em>, as a result of their education. As a matter of
fact, the more vital the experiences, the more apparent it becomes
to both teacher and pupil that the fixing of knowledge or
the acquiring of skill is a necessary condition of present efficiency
and of future progress. The children who have the most
genuine need for the multiplication table will be the first to
learn it. If you are to read to a whole school and want to
have them enjoy with you the selection which you are to interpret,
you will have the best possible reason for good expression.
History means something, if you really need to
know the history of a period in order to reproduce accurately
its language, manners, dress, and the like in your festival.
The mistake which at times has been made by enthusiastic
teachers of neglecting the drill side of the work, has not been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
due to any difficulty which the situation presented from the
standpoint of the children who are engaged in meaningful
activities.</p>

<p>The teacher may not expect all children to gain equally in
command of the experiences represented by the course of study.
For her there must literally be courses of study for each subject,
in that she must adapt her work in so far as is possible to
individual needs. The office of teacher may well be exalted,
for it is the teacher who must, because of her insight, provide
for the needs of each child committed to her care, and in rendering
this service provide society with its greatest asset, a
truly educated human being.</p>

<p><em>Book:</em> Cook and Cropsey’s <cite>New Elementary Arithmetic</cite> (for use of
teacher), pp. 1 to 46.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty in the work of this grade is in teaching the arithmetical
forms as applied to concrete processes. Pupils should know
very thoroughly the work given on pages 1 to 23, Cook and Cropsey’s
<cite>Arithmetic</cite>, before any new forms are taught. They have up to this
time used the arithmetical signs and the sentence, and have stated results
only. New forms for addition and subtraction are first applied to concrete
processes on page 24. No other forms should be taught until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
pupils are very familiar with these. A drill should be given showing
that these two forms are identical and that we must first know what we
wish to use them for, if applied to problems. Write</p>

<p>Pupils should be very familiar with these forms before any written
concrete work is given.</p>

<p>When the new form for multiplication is introduced, this drill should
be repeated:</p>

<table class="autotable fs85 wd50">

</tr>
</table>

<p>Nothing new should be added to this until pupils can use these forms
without confusion.</p>

<p>When presenting the new forms for division and partition the same
method may be used, but pupils should use the form for division some
weeks before using the same form for partition. It is not necessary to
use the division form for partition until the last four weeks of the term,
and not even then, if there seems to be any danger of confusion in using
the same form for both processes. The terms <em>division</em> and <em>partition</em>
should not be used. The terms <em>measure</em> and <em>finding one of the equal
parts</em> can be easily understood. Pupils should be able to read arithmetical
forms well, before any use is made of these forms in their application
to written concrete work.</p>

<p>All concrete problems should be simple and within the child’s experience.</p>

<p><em>Mathematics</em>: If the children are actually doing work which has
social value, they must gain accurate knowledge of the activities in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
they are engaged. They will keep a record of all expenses for materials
used in the school, and will do simple bookkeeping in connection with
the store which has charge of this material. In cooking, weights and
measures will be learned. The children will also keep accounts of the
cost of ingredients. Proportions will be worked out in the cooking
recipes. When the children dramatize the life of the trader, in connection
with history, they have opportunity to use all standards of
measurements. Number is demanded in almost all experimental science
work; for instance, the amount of water contained in the different kinds
of fruit, or the amount of water evaporated from fruits under different
conditions (in drying fruits). All plans for wood work will be worked
to a scale and demand use of fractions. When the children have encountered
many problems which they must solve in order to proceed
with their work, they are ready to be drilled on the processes involved
until they gain facility in the use of these. The children should be able
to think through the problems which arise in their daily work, and have
automatic use of easy numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication,
short division, and easy fractions.</p>

<span class="fs80">MEASURING RESULTS IN EDUCATION</span></h2>


<p>Efficiency in any line of human endeavor depends upon
our ability to evaluate the results which are secured. No one
would question the progress which has been made in education
during the past hundred years; but one may very justly inquire
concerning the efficiency of the work that has been done
from the standpoint of the money which has been spent, and
the effort and devotion of those who have engaged in teaching.
In the mercantile pursuits it has been noted that seven out of
every ten failures can be charged directly to a lack of knowledge
of facts. Such investigations as we have had in education
tend to prove that a like situation is to be found in this
field. The failures in education, whether due to a lack of
economical use of the funds available, to an inefficient system
of organization, or to unintelligent practices in method, are,
on the whole, not to be charged to a lack of devotion on the
part of those who have given their lives to the schools. Until
it is possible to measure the results achieved, the facts of success
or failure cannot be established.</p>

<p>Of course, no one would deny that real progress is made by
the process of trial and success, both in the art of teaching and
in the practice of administration. It is true, too, that we shall
have to depend in considerable measure upon demonstration
as a means of bringing about improvement in current educational
practice. It is none the less true, however, that scientific
work in education will furnish the basis for the more rapid
elimination of the mistakes in current practice, as well as point
the way for improved organization of teaching. The science
of education will, in its development, occupy relatively the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
same position with reference to the art of teaching that the
science of medicine occupies with respect to the art of healing.
The progress which has been made during the past twenty-five
years in the art of farming would never have been possible
without the scientific work that has been done in agriculture.</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that we are only beginning to have a
profession of education, many other factors have entered to
delay the progress in the direction of standardizing our work
by means of accurate measurement of the results achieved.
One of the most comforting of the fallacies which are at times
urged against the attempt to measure results is found in the
popular statement that the only criterion by which the success
of school work can be measured is found in the ultimate success
of the individuals who are subjected to the process. The most
inefficient teacher in the most poorly equipped school, if his
period of service has been long enough, will point to the success
of a few of the boys who once attended that particular school,
as proof of the adequacy of the work which is now being done.
The failures are never brought to mind. The fallacious reasoning
found in such an appeal is all too common in our educational
discussion. To take a selected group of individuals,
who have, because of native ability, and possibly because of
favorable environment, achieved distinction; and to claim
that this success is due to our system of education, may be
satisfying to our pride, but cannot appeal to our good judgment.
The only available measure of the success of the work
done in any particular school is to be found in the changes
which are brought about in boys and girls, young men and
young women, during the period of their school life.</p>

<p>It has been argued, too, that that which is most worth while
in education cannot be measured. Those who advance
this argument speak continually in terms of “atmosphere,”
“spirit,” and the like. There are two replies to be made to this
contention. The one is that any power which the teacher
has, whether it is called influence, or ability to teach arithmetic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
must result in some change in the children who are
taught. Another equally valid answer is to be found in the
fact that the best teachers of arithmetic, of literature, of
geography, of history, and the other studies are, at the same
time, the teachers whose influence we value most in the school.</p>

<p>We have been hopeful that the sciences of biology, psychology,
sociology, and economics would, in their development,
solve the problems of education. No one would deny
the significance of the work done in these fields as fundamental
to the development of scientific work in education. No one
is fully equipped to undertake investigation in the field of
education without preliminary training in these fundamental
sciences. Progress in the science of education has come,
however, through the efforts of those men of sound fundamental
training who have attacked the problems of education
as such, rather than through the work of the biologist, psychologist,
sociologist, or economist. If we should wait for the
sciences mentioned to solve our problems, progress would
indeed be slow.</p>

<p>Those who are unacquainted with modern statistical methods
as applied in the social sciences have at times felt that
it was impossible to measure large groups of individuals who
differ in ability, in interest, and in environment. It is impossible
within the limits of a brief chapter to make clear the
validity of such measurement. It may be confidently asserted,
however, that the measurement of a large group of individuals
is, on the whole, more satisfactory than the attempt to measure
a single individual. We can be more sure of the accuracy
of our results in comparing two groups of children of a thousand
each, than we could in the attempt to measure accurately
a single individual with regard to ability in school subjects.</p>

<p>A most persistent objection to the measuring of results comes
from those who feel that it is not fair to compare individuals
or groups who are not alike in all particulars. They would
claim, for example, that we cannot compare children in spelling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
ability when one group comes from homes in which the English
language is spoken, while the other comes from the homes
of those who speak a foreign language. It is probable that
this objection is due to a belief that measurement will result
in a comparison of the present situation without any regard
to the growth or development which has characterized the
group. If we derive units of measurement in spelling, manifestly
the attempt would be to measure the changes which have
been brought about in any group in terms of units which are
comparable. If group one shows ability ten, having advanced
during the year from ability seven, it will be considered just
as satisfactory as the advance which has been made in group
two, which has moved from ability eight to ability eleven.
In other words, the purpose of measurement is never to attempt
to make all alike. It is rather to discover differences and the
reason for their existence; but most of all to give us some
adequate means of determining progress or change.</p>

<p>Let us suppose again, in a matter of business administration,
that one school shows a much higher per capita cost than
another. This does not prove that one school is more efficiently
managed than another. What it does do is to suggest
that some adequate reason is to be found for the difference
which exists. In like manner, one city may show a much
higher cost for janitors’ salaries than does another. This may
suggest investigation, but it does not prove that the city with
the higher cost for janitors’ service is inefficiently managed
or extravagant in its expenditures. It may be that the city
that spends a relatively large amount for janitorial service
actually gets more per dollar for the money which it spends
than does the city with the smaller cost. It is always a purpose
of measurement to discover discrepancies and to raise problems.</p>

<p>It has been contended that it is not important to derive
scales or units of measurement on the ground that the scientific
study of education is significant only in so far as it has to do
with a careful investigation of the processes involved in growth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
Those who make this contention seem to feel that a careful
study of the way in which children come to form habits, to
grow in power of reasoning, or in ability to appreciate, will give
us the final answer concerning the methods to be employed in
teaching. The difficulty with this point of view is that human
beings, even though they be trained in investigation, are fallible.
The only final test of the success of any method, however
carefully derived, and however much of it may depend upon
a knowledge of the processes involved in growth in the particular
aspect of mental life which is involved, is to be found
in the result achieved. Theoretically a method may seem to
be perfect, and yet in terms of the results which are secured it
may prove to be a failure. If the results are not accurately
measured, if we do not derive scales of measurement, we can
never be certain of our conclusions with regard to the method
to be employed in bringing about any particular type of mental
growth or development.</p>

<p>Possibly the one element in the situation which has operated
to retard development in the direction of accurate measurement
of results, more than any other, is the tendency in education
to appeal to authority, and the corresponding lack of devotion
to scientific investigation. It is, of course, much easier
to solve the problems which one meets by taking the opinion
of those who have had experience in the field. No one would
deny the value of the judgment of our great educational leaders.
The fact remains, however, that these same leaders would be
the last ones to place their own opinion in opposition to the
results obtained from a careful scientific investigation. Indeed,
it is in no small measure due to the insistence of these
leaders that we are coming to have adequate investigations
with regard to our educational practice.</p>

<p>It has seemed necessary to discuss at some length the objections
which have been made against the attempt to measure
results in education, rather than to devote more space to a discussion
of the work which has already been done. All students<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
of education are familiar with the early work of Rice, and with
the later contributions of Thorndike, Ayres, Cornman, and
many others who have contributed to the literature of educational
investigation. Possibly the most significant piece of
work that has been done is Thorndike’s scale for measuring
handwriting.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> We may reasonably hope to have scales derived
for the measurement of abilities in other subjects.</p>

<p>In administration, considerable work has already been
done with reference to the cost of education, both as regards
the relationship of expenditure for education to other expenditures,
the question of a proper distribution of money
within the educational budget, and of the proper distribution
of state school funds.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> We can, of course, hope for much more
significant work in this field as more adequate systems of
accounting are introduced and more satisfactory reports are
issued. It is noteworthy that in those school systems in
which an attempt has been made to check up expenditures
carefully, remarkable savings have been made. We have not
yet reached the limit of possible reduction of expenditure without
the sacrifice of our present efficiency. Much work has
been done on problems of school organization, yet the problems
of retardation and elimination will be satisfactorily treated
only as we secure more accurate records concerning attendance,
scholarship, health, promotions, and demotions, such as are
provided for by the genetic records now kept in some of our
more progressive school systems. The problems of departmental
work and individual instruction can never be satisfactorily
solved until we measure accurately the results
secured under different systems of organization.</p>

<p>Implicit in all of the argument which has been advanced in
favor of measuring results is the contention that education
means change. If changes are brought about in the children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
who are being educated, then there must be the possibility of
measurement. These changes may take place in habit, in
knowledge, in methods of work, in interests and ideals, and in
power of appreciation. Probably no one would question the
possibility of measuring the change which takes place in the
formation of habits. We have quite commonly been willing
to measure growth in knowledge by tests which demand that
students not only remember facts, but that they show some
ability to apply them. Whether or not a student commands
a particular method of work can be determined by observation
of his method of procedure as well as by the results that
he secures. If interests or ideals are changed, there necessarily
follows a change in activity. Any real power of appreciation
will be accompanied by some change in expression.</p>

<p>The fact that we do not yet have scales or units of measurement
which will enable us to evaluate accurately the results
obtained in all of the different forms of school activity is not
an argument against the possibility of measurement. In any
field the development of units of measurement is dependent
upon careful investigation, and upon a realization of the imperfection
of the units already used. It is only as we insist upon
measurement that we can hope to have our units refined.
Take for example the problem of grades or marks which are
commonly assigned to students as a measure of their efficiency
in doing school work. Any investigation of these units will
show that there is very great variation in their application by
different members of the teaching corps.</p>

<p>The way to bring about a remedy is not to abolish all marks
or grades, but rather to study the problem of the proper distribution
of marks, and, if necessary, to weigh differently the
marks of different instructors. The more imperfect the unit
of measure which we now apply, the greater the need for insisting
upon accurate measurement.</p>

<p>The first step in the development of scientific inquiry in any
field is found in accurate description of the phenomena involved.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
The demand that we measure results in education is
simply a demand that the basis for scientific investigation be
made available by means of this accurate description of the
situation as it exists. Some investigators in education have
already been able to take the further steps in scientific inquiry
which have enabled them to foretell with considerable accuracy
the results which might be expected in education under given
conditions. Further progress is, however, dependent upon
that sort of measurement which will discover problems which
are not now clearly defined or which have not yet been thought
of. Of course, as inferences are made in the light of the problems
suggested, there will be still further necessity for accurate
measurement. When those who are charged with the responsibility
of determining educational policy appeal to fact
rather than to opinion, when we are able to evaluate accurately
that which we achieve, educational progress will be assured
and a profession of education will have been established.</p>

<p>We shall always have most excellent work in teaching
done by those for whom scientific investigation, as such, means
little. The investigations made will, however, modify the
practice of these same teachers through changed demands and
because of the demonstration of the validity of the new method
of work by those who can appreciate the significance of results
achieved by investigators. It is certainly to be expected that
open-minded teachers will experiment for themselves and will
aid in the work of the expert who must use the schools as his
laboratory. Much depends upon the coöperation and good
will of all who are engaged in teaching. It is not too much
to expect that the spirit of investigation will be found in large
measure to characterize those whose privilege it is to provide
the situation in which intellectual development is stimulated.</p>

<p>An example of a study involving the coöperation of the pupils,
teachers, and supervisory officers of twenty-six separate schools
or school systems is Dr. C. W. Stone’s study on <cite>Arithmetical
Abilities and Some of the Factors Determining them</cite>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
The following quotations from Dr. Stone’s study indicate the
type of result which we may hope to get from such investigations.</p>


    <div class="fs85">
<p class="p2 center"><em>In Reasoning</em></p>

<p>The scores for the reasoning problems were determined from the
results of two preliminary tests—one, giving one hundred 6th grade
pupils all the time they needed to do the problems as well as they could
in the order as printed (see page 11); and another, giving one hundred
6th grade pupils all the time they needed to do the problems as well as
they could in the <em>reverse</em> order from that as printed. The results as
tabulated below in table II show that scores for reasoning problems of
Grade VI pupils can be very definitely arranged in a scale on the basis
of relative difficulty. Just what the scale should be can only be determined
by determining the form of distribution and the location of the
zero point. From what is known of these the scale of weighting shown
in the last column of table II is believed to be the best, and this is the
one employed in the computations of this study. However, in order to
enable the reader to satisfy himself as to which is the best method, the
scores of the twenty-six systems were calculated on each of three other
bases—(1) counting each problem reasoned correctly a score of 1;
(2) counting each problem reasoned correctly a score based on the ratio
of its difficulty as shown in the next to the last column of table II; and
(3) counting the scores made on only the first six problems for which
presumably all pupils of all systems had ample time. See Appendix,
p. 98.</p>

<p>In both reasoning and fundamentals the scores used as a measure of
the achievement of a system were computed by combining the scores
of one hundred pupils. Where more than one hundred pupils were
tested, the papers used were drawn at random, the number drawn from
each class being determined by the ratio of its number to the total number
tested in the system. Where less than one hundred pupils were
tested, the combined scores made were raised to the basis of one hundred
pupils.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><em>Precautions observed to make the Scoring Accurate</em></p>

<p>The simplicity of the tests made the scoring comparatively easy; and
with the observance of the following precautions it is believed that a
high degree of accuracy was attained. (1) In so far as practicable, all
the papers were scored by a single judge—only two persons being employed
on any phase of the work for the entire twenty-six systems;
(2) each problem was scored through one hundred or more papers, then
the next followed through, etc.; (3) the score for each part of each
problem, the errors, etc., were entered on a blank provided with a separate
column for each item; (4) where there was doubt as to how the
score should be made, the scorer made a written memorandum of how
the case was finally decided and this memorandum served as the guide
for all future similar cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>


<p class="p2 center"><em>What the Scores Measure</em></p>

<p>As used in this study the words <em>achievements</em>, <em>products</em>, <em>abilities</em>,
except where otherwise qualified, must necessarily refer to the results
of the particular tests employed in this investigation. That some systems
may achieve other and possibly quite as worth-while results from
their arithmetic work is not denied; but what is denied is that any
system can safely fail to attain good results in the work covered by
these particular tests. Whatever else the arithmetic work may produce,
it seems safe to say that by the end of the sixth school year, it
should result in at least good ability in the four fundamental operations
and the simple, everyday kind of reasoning called for in these problems.
It does not then seem unreasonable, in view of the precautions previously
enumerated, to claim that the scores made by the respective
systems afford a reliable measure of the products of their respective procedures
in arithmetic.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><em>The Data</em></p>

<p>The source of the data used to help answer the above questions is
some six thousand test papers gathered from twenty-six representative
school systems. Copies of the tests may be found in Part I, pages 10
and 11; as may also a statement of conditions under which the tests
were personally given by the author, page 13; and the method of scoring,
pages 15 to 18.</p>

<p>The achievements are considered from two standpoints—(1) the
scores and mistakes of the systems as systems, (2) the scores of individual
pupils as individuals.</p>

<p>Table III gives the scores made in reasoning by each of the twenty-six
systems, counting all the problems that were solved, and weighting
them according to the last column of table II. The Roman numerals
used in the left-hand column to designate the systems are those that fell
to each system by lot. As seen by the column headed <em>scores made</em>, the
systems are arranged according to number of scores, <em>i.e.</em> system XXIII
made three hundred fifty-six points, the lowest score, and is placed first
in the table; system XXIV made four hundred twenty-nine points, and
is placed second, etc. System V, having made the highest score, is
placed last in the table.</p>

</table>

<p class="p2">The middle column gives the deviations from the median, which is
that measure above and below which one half the cases lie. In this
table the median is five hundred fifty-one. These deviations serve to
show the differences in scores made; and they are also employed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
computing the measures of variability and relationship. The third
column is the deviations in per cent of the median. It affords another
expression of the difference in size of scores made by the systems.</p>

<p>Table IV reads exactly as III, the scores<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> being those made on all
problems of the test in fundamentals. These two tables give some
general help on the nature of the product of the first six years of arithmetic
work. One very evident fact is the lack of uniformity among
systems; another is the lack of correspondence of relative position
among the systems in the two tables. With the exception of systems
XXIII and XIV, no system occupies the same relative position in the
two tables, <em>e.g.</em> system XXIV stands second from the lowest in reasoning
and eighteenth from the lowest in fundamentals. This fact is more
accurately summarized in the coefficients of correlation, table XV,
p. 37.</p>

<p>As seen from its heading, table XXII gives the systems in order of
achievements. These serial standings are derived from tables III and
IV. Reading from the top, system XXIII has an average serial standing
of <em>one</em>, being lowest in both reasoning and fundamentals; system
XXV ranks <em>three</em> in average serial standing, being <em>fourth</em> from lowest in
reasoning and <em>second</em> from lowest in fundamentals; the readings for
the other systems are similar.</p>

</table>

<p class="pad6 fs80">.. &#160; = no time assigned.</p>


<p class="p2">Tables XXIII and XXIV keep the same order of systems and show
the time expenditure. The first line of table XXIII reads,—system
XXIII ranks fourteenth from the lowest in time expenditure, with 1150
week minutes devoted to arithmetic, 9675 week minutes devoted to all
subjects, the 1150 week minutes devoted to arithmetic being 12 per
cent of the 9675 week minutes devoted to all subjects. Similarly for
the other systems, <em>e.g.</em> system XXV with a serial standing in abilities
of <em>three</em>, and a serial standing in time expenditure of <em>two</em>, spends 722
week minutes on arithmetic, and 8700 week minutes on all subjects,
arithmetic costing 8 per cent of all the school time. The reader will
recognize that the third column, which gives the time devoted to all subjects
for one week of each of the first six years, gives the only new data of
this table, column two being the same as given in table XXI and the
first and fourth columns being derived from the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>Probably the first essential shown by this table is the lack of correspondence
between the serial standing in time cost and the serial standing
in abilities; <em>e.g.</em> the system with the lowest time cost is found by
referring to table XIII to be system XXII, which is seen in table XXII
to rank <em>four and one-half</em> in average abilities. Similarly, the system
that ranks <em>fifteenth</em> in time cost, ranks <em>fifth</em> in abilities, etc. Another
noticeable showing is the wide variability in the <em>school time</em> of the systems.
It will be seen to vary from 7200 to 9900 week minutes. This time
includes recesses, and it means that lengths of school days vary from an
average of four hours to five and one-half hours. And if the names of
the systems were given, it would be recognized that almost invariably the
longer school hours are accompanied by the least amount of variation
in program, such as physical education, field trips, assemblies, etc. Perhaps
the other most striking fact of this table is the wide variation in
the per cent of time devoted to arithmetic. It varies from 22 per cent
for system IV to 7 per cent for system XXII, a difference of more than
three to one.</p>

<p>As table XXIV is part of the discussion of factors in time expenditure,
its sample readings are given under that heading, page 62.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><em>The Relation of Time Expenditure to Abilities Produced</em></p>

<p>The reader found one indication of the relation, or lack of relation,
between time cost and products in tables XXII and XXIII. Each of
the three following tables expresses these same facts.</p>

</table>

<p class="p2">The above details are compiled from the scores of individual systems
as given in tables III and IV, the median cost being that given in table
XXI. As measured by the time used in school, the thirteen systems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
with less than the median cost stand slightly the better; and as measured
by the time including home study, the thirteen systems with more
than the median time cost stand somewhat the better. The time used
in school is doubtless the more exact measure, but, as shown in table
XXI, some systems depend on home study to a considerable extent.
Hence both measures are used. The lack of relation indicated in this
general way is shown more accurately in the table, page 263, in terms
of coefficients of correlation.</p>

<p>The order of systems in this table is determined by the first column,
which gives the average serial standing as determined by the ratios of
time to products. The right-hand column under each heading gives
the ratio of time expenditure to abilities produced, and the left-hand
column gives the serial order of that system as measured by the highness
of the ratio, <em>i.e.</em> highness of cost per unit of product; <em>e.g.</em> in system
IV the ratio of time to reasoning is 3.99 (see fourth column), the highest
ratio in reasoning (determined by dividing the time cost, 1854 week
minutes, by 464, the points made in reasoning). The ratio of time to
fundamentals in this system is .52; giving an average ratio of 2.26.
That is to say, the ratio of time to abilities in system IV is as 2.26 to 1,
the highest among the twenty-six systems.</p>

<p>That there is no direct ratio between time expenditure and abilities
is again shown by this table. For example, system XXII, which spends
the least amount of time (see table XXI), ranks fourth from the lowest
in abilities (see table XXII), ranks 25th, that is, next to the highest, in
ratio of time cost to abilities produced; and, what is even more striking,
system XXVI, which spends third from the least amount of time, ranks
third from the highest in abilities and 26th or <em>highest</em> in the ratio of time
cost to abilities produced.</p>

<p>That a large amount of time expended is no guarantee of a high standard
of abilities may again be convincingly seen by comparing the ratios
of the five systems spending the smallest amount of time with the five
spending the largest. Of the five spending the least time, the average
ratio is .80, which corresponds with the 23d or the 3d from the best in
ratio; and of the five spending the greatest amount of time, the average
ratio is 1.57, which corresponds with the 4th poorest in ratio.</p>

<p>The last three tables have each shown the decided lack of relationship
between time cost and abilities produced, and hence for these
systems it is evident that there is practically no relation between time
expenditure and arithmetical abilities; and, in view of the representative
nature of these twenty-six systems, it is probable that this lack of
relationship is the rule the country over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>This is not to say that a certain amount of time is not essential to the
production of arithmetical abilities; nor that, given the same other
factors, operating equally well, the product will not increase somewhat
with an increased time expenditure. What is claimed is that, as present
practice goes, a large amount of time spent on arithmetic is no guarantee
of a high degree of efficiency. If one were to choose at random among
the schools with more than the median time given to arithmetic, the
chances are about equal that he would get a school with an inferior
product; and conversely, if one were to choose among the schools with
less than the median time cost, the chances are about equal that he
would get a school with a superior product in arithmetic.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>So far, then, as ability in arithmetic means ability to handle such
foundation work as is measured by the tests in this study, this “essential”
has not <em>necessarily</em> suffered by the introduction of other subjects
and the consequent reduction of its time allotment.</p>
    </div>

<p class="p2">One would need to read the whole study to appreciate fully
the nature of the investigation. From the pages quoted, however,
it must be apparent that: (1) schools and school systems
vary greatly in the results which they secure in arithmetic;
(2) the excellence of the work done is not directly proportional
to the time expended. We will find it necessary to
revise our opinions with regard to the organization of school
subjects, the allotment of time, the methods of teaching, and
the like, in proportion as we have careful investigation in these
several fields.</p>

<p class="p2 p1b center">II. First Steps in Instruction</p>

<p><b>1.</b> <span class="smcap">Material.</span></p>

<div class="pad1">
<p>1. Material should be (1) interesting, (2) literary, so far as possible, (3)
adapted to the capacities and tastes of children, (4) of enough difficulty and
sufficiently above their own ordinary thoughts to have value as instruction.</p>

<p>2. The best material (1) folk stuff, such as the classic fairy tales, Mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
Goose, etc., (2) tales of heroism and sacrifice, (3) poetry of the simpler type,
like that of Stevenson and Christina Rossetti.</p>

<p>3. Much of the language work should be free conversation between the
teacher and the children about their ordinary experiences.</p>
</div>

<p><b>2.</b> <span class="smcap">Method.</span></p>

<div class="pad1">
<p>1. During the first years much of the literary material must be given orally
by the teacher. Oral work is to be held of great importance.</p>

<p>2. Children to be encouraged to commit good things to memory.</p>

<p>3. All reading aloud by the pupils to be done as naturally as possible. Importance
of reading by phrases and sentences, rather than word by word.</p>

<p>4. Value of the dramatic element in early work.</p>

<p>5. The conflict between the “word method” and the “sentence method”
over. Modern teaching eclectic in method. If any name can be given to the
best way, it might be, perhaps, “thought method.”</p>

<p>6. Use of script and print: advantages of each as a first form. Value of
printed cards and other devices for drill.</p>

<p>7. Form of type for beginners’ books: not too large; letters to have all
differentiating marks <em>distinct</em>. Importance of right kind of paper, width of
columns, etc. Kinds of pictures most serviceable.</p>

<p>8. When shall writing begin? In general not to be forced on the child in
the first year. Arguments for and against this arrangement. Should there be
any fixed standard of accomplishment for the first year?</p>

<p>9. Phonetic drill. How many words must be known before it begins?
Various plans equally successful. The main thing, perhaps, is to have drill
enough to give the pupils <em>certainty</em> in their work, but to keep the drill subordinated
to their interest in reading.</p>

<p>10. The order of such drill. “Normal words,” chosen for their meaning,
their frequency of occurrence, and their similarity in form to other words
either at their beginning or at their end. Many words, however, must be
learned without relation to such a scheme.</p>

<p>11. “Normal sentences” those that partially help the reader to the recognition
of words; as, “The sun rises in the east, and sets in the west.” For young
children, sentences involving the use of repetitive phrases must also be regarded
as normal, as in “The House that Jack Built.”</p>

<p>12. In general, both analysis and synthesis to be used in word drill.</p>

<p>13. Importance of securing good habits as to intelligent reading, correct
spelling, etc., in the early years. Children can usually do better than they or
their elders think they can.</p>

<p>14. Emphasis to be placed upon reading many of the good things over and
over, until they are known in whole and in part.</p>

<p class="p2 p1b center">III. The Teaching of Literature</p>

<p><b>1.</b> <span class="smcap">General Problems.</span></p>

<div class="pad1">
<p>1. Can literature be <em>taught</em>? Or can pupils “be taught through literature”?
Examples of such educational use of literature.</p>

<p>2. Present aims in teaching literature: entertainment, portrayal of life, acquaintance
with the world of thought and feeling as presented in books, cultivation
of imagination and sense of beauty.</p>

<p>3. True interpretation implies grasping the central purpose, idea, or feeling of
the piece.</p>

<p>4. Various types of literature demand various treatment. Necessity of adapting
the treatment to the class.</p>

<p>5. Taste (sense of beauty) developed mainly by contact with good models.
Instruction plays a minor part. The love of good reading fostered by judicious
selection of material, and by example and influence.</p>

<p>6. How can the habit of good reading be cultivated?</p>
</div>

<p><b>2.</b> <span class="smcap">Material.</span></p>

<div class="pad1">
<p>1. The literature chosen must be suitable in its themes, its action, its feeling,
its simplicity.</p>

<p>2. Literary histories and biographies: their limited value in elementary work.</p>

<p>3. Scientific and historical material in literature. Literary use of such material
not to be confounded with science and history.</p>

<p>4. Pictures and other illustrative material: Sometimes give intuitive basis
for desired concepts; sometimes interfere with the imagination.</p>
</div>

<p><b>3.</b> <span class="smcap">Method.</span></p>

<div class="pad1">
<p>1. Reading aloud: its value. Means of securing good results; interest, sense

</div>

<p>3. Correlation of literature with other work possible in limited degree. A

of study. A problem for the teacher rather than the principal.</p>

<p>4. Treatment of allusions, historical, literary, etc. The need of judicious
selection.</p>

<p>5. Treatment of figures of speech, verse forms, new words, etc.</p>

<p>6. Lesson plans: their function and value.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p><em>A.</em> No one course available for all localities.</p>

<p><em>D.</em> The emphasis to be given to continental work.</p>

<p>Division of work by grades.</p>

<p><em>E.</em> Disadvantages of teaching all continents twice.</p>

<p>The following compromise is suggested as in general workable:</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>a.</em> Twice: North America, United States, Europe, and perhaps portions
of Asia.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>b.</em> Once: Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Present importance of South America.</p>
</div>

<p><em>F.</em> Plan of intermediate work should differ from plan of upper grades.
“Concentric Circles.”</p>

<p><em>G.</em> The place of physical geography in the course of study:</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>a.</em> Home geography: observational side.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Danger of overemphasis, of giving wrong outlook.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>b.</em> Intermediate grades: give setting to life side.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Larger facts only.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>c.</em> Upper grade: basis of work.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; Not to be taught as a topic by itself but as a means to an end.</p>
</div>

<p><em>H.</em> Emphasis of industries and commercial side.</p>

<p><em>I.</em> “Following interests of children,”—best meaning of phrase. Value
and dangers.</p>

<p>Recent interest in industrial education places a renewed obligation on
geography to be practical and to be free from fads.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p><em>A.</em> Home geography not a subject or a division of geography, but a method
of approach to field as a whole,—cannot have a uniform course for all places.</p>

<p><em>B.</em> Method of procedure must be from known to unknown through analysis
of experiences of pupils.</p>

<p><em>C.</em> Work should not call for knowledge of distant places.</p>

<p><em>D.</em> Lessons should become more intensive and scope more extensive.</p>

<p><em>E.</em> Topics should be taken up in definite sequence so far as possible.</p>

<p><em>F.</em> Definitions, if any, to be summaries at close of developed points and not
points of departure.</p>

<p><em>G.</em> Units developed to be good geography units which may be used as basis
for comparison over world. Heat, storms, woods, for instance, are not good
units. Crossroads or city corners good units.</p>

<p><em>H.</em> Local history to be brought in as much as possible.</p>

<p>Should be intimately related to geography and may often be point of
departure.</p>

<p><em>I.</em> Importance of observation of local conditions.</p>

<p>Reasons for giving a certain place to processes of earth change.</p>

<p><em>B.</em> Industrial geography deals with the geography underlying the principal
human occupations: that is, the reason for the occurrence of industries in given
localities.</p>

<p><em>C.</em> Commercial geography deals with the elementary principles of trade and
commerce, and includes a study of geography of great regions of production
and demand, with causes. Emphasizes interrelation of commercial areas and
reasons for same.</p>

<p><em>D.</em> Industrial geography should be emphasized in intermediate years; commercial
geography in the upper grades.</p>

<p><em>E.</em> Industrial geography should include the study of groupings of peoples
according to occupations and lead up to a knowledge of the simpler reasons
therefor. These groups are agriculture, grazing, lumbering, mining, manufacturing,
commerce, and “scenic centers.”</p>

<p><em>F.</em> Geography does not call for study of technique of industries, and should
not include special study of details of industries. Futility of studying processes.
Geographic side includes the reasons for industry and not the manner of it.
Technique is largely result of human invention and is not geographic except possibly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>

relations of peoples to their geographic surroundings.</p>

<p><em>H.</em> Commercial geography should be based on knowledge of industrial and
physical geography of earlier years, and should be a part of regional geography—not
a special topic. It should include study of routes of trade, areas
of supply and consumption of <em>chief</em> foods, textiles, manufactured products,
raw materials, etc., and relative status of chief commercial nations, and
reasons.</p>

<p class="p2 p1b center">XIII. The Geographic Preparation of a Teacher of Geography</p>

<p>It is neither possible nor desirable to have every grade school teacher a
specialist in geography.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p><em>A.</em> The scope of work analyzed.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>a.</em> Larger portion of work will be the geography of continents in earlier or
later grades.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>b.</em> Small portion of work will be development of principles of physical and
life geography.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>c.</em> The principles will be expected to be used in continental work.</p>
</div>

<p><em>B.</em> The requisite training of a teacher must then include:</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>a.</em> Some study of larger principles so as to make these principles usable in
all grades.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>b.</em> Special study of one or more continents so as to give point of view and
method of studying a region causally.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>c.</em> Training in use of maps, especially atlas and text maps, weather maps
and United States Geological Survey Topographic Maps.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>d.</em> Knowledge of larger principles underlying geography teaching in the
grades and study of special difficulties in each phase of elementary school work.
Knowledge of subject matter is an essential basis for study of methods of
teaching.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>e.</em> These requisites suggest the necessary content and order of procedure in
geography courses in training classes.</p>
</div>

<p><em>C.</em> Desirable training that teachers should be encouraged to secure.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>a.</em> Knowledge of geography beyond the minimum outlined above and sufficient
to make them independent workers and possibly investigators in some
phase of geography.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>b.</em> Good knowledge of history of United States and Europe.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>c.</em> Knowledge of elements of anthropology, economics, and biology, particularly
along ecological lines.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>d.</em> Knowledge of modern industrial problems in the United States, particularly
along lines of agriculture, manufacturing, commerce, and conservation of
forests and water supply.</p>
</div>

<p><em>D.</em> Opportunities for securing training in geography.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>a.</em> Larger and better normal schools and many colleges and universities now
include well planned courses in geography.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>b.</em> Teachers in service will find splendid opportunities for geography work
at the summer schools of colleges and normal schools. Also in some cases in
certain phases of the subject, work may be secured in extension and correspondence
courses.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <em>c.</em> Teachers seeking summer school opportunities should go to institutions
that have summer terms, and not, as a rule, merely to summer institutions.
Geography cannot be adequately taught without equipment, and only those institutions
which are in operation the year round can have adequate equipment.</p>

<p class="p2 p1b center">I. What History is</p>

<p><b>1.</b> <span class="smcap">The Word “History” may denote</span>:</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p><em>a.</em> Past facts themselves.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Traces left by past facts.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> The study which investigates such traces.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> The knowledge thus obtained.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> An account or narrative in which such knowledge is embodied.</p>
</div>

<p><b>2.</b> <span class="smcap">The Sources of Historical Knowledge.</span></p>

<div class="hang4">

<p><em>a.</em> Primary sources.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; 1. Material remains—roads, buildings, tools, weapons, clothing, any
material object shaped by man or associated with his life on the
earth.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; 2. Reports of conditions and events made by actual observers. Such
reports may be oral, written or printed, pictorial.</p>
</div>

<p><em>b.</em> Secondary sources—reports or accounts based upon primary sources.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> Accounts based upon other accounts in varying degrees of removal even
from secondary sources.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Existing sources relate to fragments only of man’s total experience in the
world.</p>
</div>

<p><b>3.</b> <span class="smcap">Historical Criticism—the Foundation for the Determination
of Particular Facts relating to the Past.</span></p>

<div class="hang4">

<p><em>a.</em> External criticism—investigation of the origin and transmission of
sources; a study of form, language, writing. Is the material remaining
authentic? Who was the author of the document? What did he say?</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Internal criticism—investigation of the content of sources. What did
the author mean? Are his statements true?</p>

<p><em>c.</em> The need of historical criticism finds daily illustration in the schoolroom,
in ordinary conversation, in the newspapers.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Historical criticism first formally applied by the Greeks. Not fully developed
until modern times.</p>
</div>

<p><b>4.</b> <span class="smcap">Historical Synthesis—putting the Facts together into a Body
of Organized Knowledge.</span></p>

<div class="hang4">

<p><em>a.</em> The chronological order—facts arranged according to time of occurrence.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> The geographical order—facts arranged according to place of occurrence.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> The logical order—facts arranged according to their intrinsic nature.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p><em>a.</em> The subject embraced.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; 1. A single person.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; 2. A single people—whole known period or a part of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>&#160; &#160; 3. The whole world—universal history.</p>
</div>

<p><em>b.</em> General conceptions of history writing.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; 1. A narrative of memorable events. Aim, mainly to please. Content
determined by taste of authors and their public. Epic poets and
story-tellers early contributors. Classical type fixed by Herodotus,
the “father of history.”</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; 2. A collection of precedents supposed to be useful to statesmen, generals,
and others. Aim, didactic. Content determined by the kind of
examples or lessons needed. But these, according to early conceptions,
to be valuable must be true to the facts. Facts largely political
and military. A conception introduced by Thucydides and
developed by Polybius.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; 3. Scientific history. Aim, to exhibit the past as it was and to explain how
it came to be what it was. Content determined by what is regarded
as significant in illustrating the idea of development in human
affairs.</p>
</div>

<p><em>c.</em> These general conceptions correspond roughly to stages of human culture.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> History generally regarded merely as a branch of literature up to 1850.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> Side by side with scientific histories, works of the older types are still
being produced.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p><em>a.</em> Kinds of historical facts.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; 1. Facts relating to physical appearance of men and their material environment.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <em>a.</em> Possibility of direct appeal to the senses.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <em>b.</em> The simplest illustration of change in the world.</p>

to be interesting.</p>
</div>

<p>&#160; &#160; 2. Facts relating to what men did.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <em>a.</em> Direct sense appeal not applicable.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <em>b.</em> Only actions now in progress can be observed.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <em>c.</em> With these as a basis actions in progress in the past more or less
readily imaged.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <em>d.</em> That action appeals to children an axiom of history teaching.</p>
</div>

<p>&#160; &#160; 3. Facts relating to thoughts and feelings of men, the motives that moved
them to do or to say.</p>
</div>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <em>a.</em> Known only through deeds and words.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <em>b.</em> Real understanding of the past measured by pupil’s ability to enter
this inner life of history.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <em>c.</em> Important to recognize difficulties and limitations.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <em>d.</em> The mental states of a Clovis, a Charlemagne, a Napoleon, or even
of a cave-man, an Indian, a pioneer, largely beyond the experience
of children and of most adults.</p>
</div>

<p>&#160; &#160; 4. In each of these groups the simplest facts relate to particular objects,
particular acts, thoughts, feelings.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; 5. Collective facts, facts relating to social groups, to institutions, to general
causes that act in history, much more difficult.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <em>a.</em> How represent a wave of prosperity? a panic? a revolution?
society itself?</p>

possible, into their concrete elements.</p>
</div>

<p><em>b.</em> The kinds of facts enumerated common to literary, didactic, and scientific
history.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> Degree of difficulty presented by a given type of facts not essentially different
for different kinds of history.</p>

as to another.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; 2. Clear visualization a factor in stimulating interest.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; 3. Clear visualization of the man, the act, the situation, a necessary key
to his mental states.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; 4. Elementary history, therefore, to be largely descriptive and narrative,
to be made up of concrete examples rather than generalized knowledge.</p>
</div>

<p><em>e.</em> Time and place relations essential to the conception of any fact as historical.
As difficult for one kind of history as for another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p><em>f.</em> Special conditions imposed by scientific history.</p>

<div class="hang4">

<p>&#160; &#160; 1. Facts in palpable conflict with present knowledge not to be regarded
as historical.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; 2. Facts to be characteristic of persons, peoples, places, periods; not
exceptional, abnormal, bizarre.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; 3. Facts to be so presented as to exhibit relations, cause and effect,
continuity.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; 4. Facts to be so presented as to arouse some consciousness of how we
know what we know about the past and why we do not know
more.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; 5. These conditions quite possible to meet within the limits suggested
by the principle of grading already set forth.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> <span class="smcap">Time Sense in Children.</span></p>

<div class="hang4">

<p><em>a.</em> Rudimentary at age of entering school. “Yesterday,” “last week,”
“last month,” have a meaning. “One hundred years ago” has not.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> The sense develops slowly. Even children of twelve or thirteen often
measure short periods of time vaguely.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> From this an argument advanced against dating any events in distant
past for children. Can mean only “a long time ago.”</p>

<p><em>d.</em> The difficulty in part removed by objective assistance—chart, rolls,
knotted cords, and other devices.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> Dates properly introduced at least as early as the fifth year.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">[34]</a> In proceeding to the part of the study that is necessarily largely composed
of tables, it may be well to state the position of the author regarding the partial
interpretations offered in connection with the tables. It is that the <em>entire
tables</em> give by far the best basis for conclusions; that for a thorough comprehension
of the study they should be read quite as fully as any other part; and
that they should be regarded as the most important source of information rather
than the brief suggestive readings which are liable to give erroneous impressions,
both because of the limitations of a single interpretation and the lack of
space for anything like full exposition.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">[35]</a> <em>M</em> = <em>Median</em>, which is the representation of central tendency used
throughout this study. It has the advantages over the average of being
more readily found, of being unambiguous, and of giving less weight to
extreme or erroneous cases.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> As stated in Part I, p. 17, a <em>score</em> is arbitrarily set at <em>one</em>. The fact that
the zero point is unknown in both reasoning and fundamentals makes these
scores less amenable to ordinary handling than they might at first thought
seem. Hence, entire distributions are either printed or placed on file at Teachers
College.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> For the data from which these calculations were made, see first column
of table XXI, p. 52, and the first columns of tables III and IV, p. 21. The
absence of known zero points makes such computations inadvisable except
in connection with the more reliable evidence of the preceding table.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">[39]</a> And it is the opinion of the author that the chances are much better that
one would get a school with a superior product in <em>education</em>.</p>

<p class="smcap pfs90">By HERMAN HARRELL HORNE, Ph.D.</p>

<p class="pfs70">Professor of the History of Philosophy and of the History of Education, New
York University</p>

<p class="rt2 fs80"><em>Cloth, 8vo, xvii + 295 pages, $1.50</em></p>

<p class="noindent pad2 fs70">A connected series of discussions on the foundations of education in the
related sciences of biology, physiology, sociology, and philosophy, and a
thoroughgoing interpretation of the nature, place, and meaning of education
in our world. The newest points of view in the realms of natural and
mental science are applied to the understanding of educational problems.
The field of education is carefully divided, and the total discussion is
devoted to the philosophy of education, in distinction from its history,
science, and art.</p>


<p class="p1 noindent fs135">The Psychological Principles of Education</p>

<p class="smcap pfs90">By HERMAN HARRELL HORNE, Ph.D.</p>

<p class="rt2 fs80"><em>Cloth, 12mo, xiii + 435 pages, $1.75</em></p>

<p class="noindent pad2 fs70">The relationship of this book to the author’s “Philosophy of Education” is
that, whereas the first was mostly theory with some practice, this is mostly
practice with some theory. This volume lays the scientific foundations for
the art of teaching so far as those foundations are concerned with psychology.
The author is the “middleman” between the psychologist and the
teacher, taking the theoretical descriptions of pure psychology and transforming
them into educational principles for the teacher. In the Introduction
the reader gets his bearings in the field of the science of
education. The remainder of the book sketches this science from the
standpoint of psychology, the four parts of the work, Intellectual Education,
Emotional Education, Moral Education, and Religious Education,
being suggested by the nature of man, the subject of education. A special
feature is the attention paid to the education of the emotions and of the will.</p>

<p class="noindent pad2 fs70">Professor Horne here discusses three things which he regards as
fundamental in the building of human character,—Heredity, Environment,
and Will. His method of handling these otherwise heavy subjects, makes
the book of interest, even to the general reader.</p>

<p class="smcap pfs90">By WILLIAM CHANDLER BAGLEY</p>

<p class="pfs70">Director of the School of Education, University of Illinois</p>


<p class="noindent fs135">Craftsmanship in Teaching</p>

<p class="rt2 fs80"><em>Cloth, 12mo, 247 pages, $1.25</em></p>

<p class="noindent pad2 fs70">Readers of “The Educative Process” and “Classroom Management”
by Director W. C. Bagley of the University of Illinois will welcome the
author’s new book on “Craftsmanship in Teaching.” The book is made
up of a series of addresses given before educational gatherings, the subject
of the first one giving the book its name. In these addresses the
personality of the author is more in evidence than is possible in his more
systematic work, but the same sane, scientific point of view is apparent
throughout.</p>


<p class="noindent fs135">Classroom Management</p>

<p class="rt2 fs80"><em>Cloth, xvii + 332 pages, $1.25</em></p>

<p class="noindent pad2 fs70">This book considers the problems that are consequent upon the massing
of children together for purposes of instruction and training. It aims to
discover how the unit-group of the school system—the “class”—can be
most effectively handled. The topics commonly included in treatises upon
school management receive adequate attention; the first day of school;
the mechanizing of routine; the daily programme; discipline and punishment;
absence and tardiness, etc.</p>


<p class="noindent fs135">The Educative Process</p>

<p class="rt2 fs80"><em>Cloth, xix + 358 pages, $1.25</em></p>

<p class="noindent pad2 fs70">The book aims to prevent a waste of energy on the part of the young
teacher by setting forth a systematic and comprehensive view of the task
that is to be accomplished by the school, with the working principles for
the attainment of the end. The best idea for the author’s plan of treatment
can be had from his division of the book. Part I discusses the
function of education and of the school in biological and sociological
terms. Part II continues the same topic from the psychological standpoint.
Part III deals with the functioning of experience in its relation to
the educative process. Part IV treats of the relation of education to the
three periods of child-development: the transitional, the formative, the
adolescent. Part V considers educational values and the necessity of
ideals in the educative process, and Part VI concludes with the technique
of teaching.</p>
